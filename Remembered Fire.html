<p>REMEMBERED FIRE</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>
  <i>…Panic roared through his veins. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>They’d been betrayed. Someone on the team had let their location slip; it was the only answer for the ambush that had been awaiting them when they’d Apparated to the destination point. He’d barely had time to hit the ground on his stomach before he heard shouting, and curses were whizzing over his head.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“It’s them!” he heard someone shout roughly as another green jet of light streaked so close to his head that he felt it singe the ends of his white-blond hair. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Malfoy! Malfoy, come on!” </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>He looked up and saw Weasley reaching for him, freckled hand outstretched, and he lunged for it like a life line, allowing himself to be yanked behind a brick wall.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“What the fuck…?” he started, then flinched and pressed his head against the bricks when a curse hit the corner near him, blasting away bits of masonry.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Ambush,” Weasley answered breathlessly, blue eyes unnaturally wide in his pale face. “Had to be… son of a bitch!”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Those words were the only warning Draco got that their new position had been compromised before a red light flashed across in front of them, striking his right thigh with a vicious slash. He knew he cried out in pain, because he’d never felt anything quite like it, and he looked down to see the dark trousers torn, the fleshy part of his leg beneath sliced nearly to the bone. He pressed his hand over the welling wound, but soon blood was pooling between his fingers, and when he tried to move, the leg was useless. It dragged behind him when Weasley grabbed his robe at the shoulder and tried to run for it.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“I can’t,” Draco cried out. “My leg. Go, just… go!”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“I can’t leave you here,” Weasley answered frantically. “Harry would never forgive me…”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“He’d never forgive me if you got yourself killed on my account…” Draco gave him a hard shove. “Go, for fuck’s sake…”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Weasley looked as if he were going to argue further when they both heard an almost animalistic scream, frightening and terrible, and looked up as one to see Harry Potter dodging hexes, muscular body ducking and weaving, dashing towards them, his robes flying and his wand shooting spells as he came.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“It’s Potter!” Someone yelled triumphantly.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“No,” Draco said desperately. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Get him out!” Harry shouted at Ron before turning. “Get him out! Now!”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>He felt an arm lock tight around his waist, felt himself jerked up and back against a strong chest, and just as Weasley was turning, Apparating them away, he saw the vile green curse that hit Harry square in the chest. He saw him go stock still and then crumble to the ground like a marionette whose strings has been severed, saw the lifeless green eyes that stared up into nothing. He heard the vicious roar of triumph from the other side.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“No!” he screamed, thrashing in Weasley’s arms, fighting to get away, fighting to get to Harry. “No, no….” And then he was falling through space with the sure conviction that his life was no longer worth living…</i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No,” Draco Malfoy murmured, head moving restlessly on the fine white linen pillowcase. “No, no…”</p>
<p>With a pained gasp, he jerked awake and lurched up, heart pounding beneath his ribs, skin covered with cold sweat that plastered his silk pajamas to his lean body. Grey eyes wide, he stared around the sumptuous suite, throat tight, tears slipping unheeded down cheeks flushed dark red. One elegant hand pressed over his galloping heart and the other went to his thigh, rubbing the knotted ridge of scar tissue with its dull, ever present ache. And as his tortured mind realized where he was, and that it had been just a dream, a nightmare, that he wasn’t actually living it again, he flopped back against his sweat dampened pillows and covered his face with his trembling hands. One would think, after nineteen years, that it wouldn’t still have the power to destroy him. But it did, oh, it still did.</p>
<p>God, he hated Anniversaries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a long soak in the sunken marble tub in his en-suite bath and a rub down with some ointment that he himself had brewed to deal with the lingering affects of his injury, he was barely limping by the time he made it down the grand staircase and into the vast entrance hall of Malfoy Manor. He’d taken time with his appearance that morning, smoothing back the short trimmed white-blond hair in the style he’d long preferred, wearing a tailored Armani suit, dark grey shirt and black silk tie. He had no intention of following wizard tradition and wearing his hair long; he’d do anything in his power to differentiate himself from his father in the minds of others, even if it meant putting his slightly receding hairline on display and wearing Muggle clothing. In fact, he’d not worn wizard’s robes since he’d been forced to retire from the Auror Division, nineteen years before. Nineteen years to the day.</p>
<p>He pushed the thought from him, fixing a blank expression on his aristocratic face as he paused near the round marble table in the center of the cavernous entry and quickly scanned through the mail that had been left neatly stacked on a silver tray. There was nothing that required his immediate attention; it was mostly invites to social events he had no intention of attending and requests for funding for one charity or another. He’d let his mother sort through it, and answer what she felt he needed to. Laying the squares of parchment back on the table, he walked through the enormous formal dining room, then on into the breakfast room. </p>
<p>Morning sunlight streamed in through the vast bank of windows that lined one side of the large room, revealing a panoramic view of his mother’s opulent gardens. The lady herself was seated at one end of the long table, wearing a sky-blue satin dressing gown, her long hair in an elegant French twist up the back of her head. Her white-blonde hair was now actually more white than blonde and there were small lines at the corners of her clear blue eyes and bracketing her lovely mouth, but he thought her more beautiful than ever. A soft floral scent drifted to him as he brushed his lips over her cheek, and her fingers when she touched his cheek were soft and cool. </p>
<p>“Good morning, mother,” he murmured before taking his seat at her right. </p>
<p>“Good morning, darling,” she responded, and then frowned slightly when she turned to look at him. “Didn’t you sleep well?” He looked at her, one brow arched. “You’re pale, my love.”</p>
<p>He looked down at his plate as he laid his linen napkin over his lap. “My leg was bothering me some.”</p>
<p>“The new potion isn’t working?” she asked, her brow furrowing slightly. “You should talk to Healer Wetherby…”</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” he said gently but firmly, looking up and touching her hand. She subsided, but sighed softly. </p>
<p>“You needn’t merely suffer in silence, darling,” she said carefully. “That’s all I’m saying.”</p>
<p>He began to respond when the warm atmosphere of the room was disturbed by a clear, cutting voice. </p>
<p>“Oh, but suffering in silence is simply how it’s done for martyr's, mother dear.” </p>
<p>Draco’s lips tightened into a flat line, and Narcissa glanced up at the owner of the voice in irritation. </p>
<p>Astoria Greengrass-Malfoy entered the sunny room wearing a deep red riding habit, her sleek black hair twisted in a style very like her mother-in-law’s. She was an exquisitely beautiful woman, her figure slender and willowy, her skin fashionably pale, but the hardness around her mouth and the cunning expression in her brown eyes spoiled the effect. Her knee high black riding boots clicked on the parquet floor as she walked, and she was holding a riding crop in one hand. She slid languidly into the chair directly across from her husband and gave him a flinty smile. </p>
<p>“I’m somewhat surprised to see you this morning, dearest,” she said, one black brow arching, eyes bright with malicious amusement.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine why,” Draco answered tightly. “I’ve meetings at the office all morning.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m quite certain that everyone would understand if you simply found it too difficult to leave your rooms today.” Draco sent her a warning look across the table, but Astoria merely smiled slowly.</p>
<p>“Whatever are you on about?” Narcissa asked in irritation. As if just waiting for the opportunity, Astoria presented a newspaper, which she’d been holding rolled in her other hand. She let it drop to the table-top and it fell open to the front page. The Headline across the top screamed ‘Nineteen Years Later’ in bold print, and beneath it was a picture, a wizard photo, of a handsome man in his late twenties with messy black hair, wide eyes behind simple spectacles and a shy, self-effacing smile. The print under the photo read; ‘Marking the Anniversary of the tragic death of Harry Potter’. Draco stared at it, and felt his throat slowly closing.</p>
<p>“Such a sad story, really,” Astoria said tightly as she watched her husbands already pale face loose what little color it had. “So young, so handsome. His whole life a head of him, with his pretty little wife and their three beautiful children.”</p>
<p>“I… find that I’m not hungry,” Draco said as calmly as he could with this throat tightening, pushing back his chair and standing abruptly. “I’ll get something later in town.” He didn’t even glance at his wife, and didn’t see the vengeful satisfaction on her face.</p>
<p>Narcissa reached out and grasped his hand. “Draco, please,” she said softly. He didn’t even look into the blue eyes; all he could think of now was escaping the suddenly stultifying atmosphere of the sunny room, and the wizard photo of the handsome face that smiled slowly, over and over again.</p>
<p>He squeezed the cool hand, and left without another word, the sound of his Italian boots clicking in an unnatural rhythm as his limp returned. He crossed to the door of the dining room and left without looking back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco walked along Diagon Alley on his way to the offices of the Malfoy Conglomerate, ignoring the quick looks and whispers that were sent his way. He was used to the attention, so much so that he now discounted it completely. He pulled the black leather over coat closed against the chill wind, but even so tendrils of it seemed to creep up under his pant leg, and his gait grew more and more stiff as his thigh muscles tightened. His soft grey cashmere scarf brushed his chin, and he could catch just a hint of fragrance rising from the softly woven strands of wool; it was fragrance he’d put there himself, fragrance from a bottle he secreted in the back of his wardrobe, which he used sparingly, dabbing just a bit onto an article of clothing that he knew would be near his face. It was his scent, the one he’d worn so long ago, and Draco hoarded each precious drop and when it was gone, he made the trip to Harrod’s in Muggle London in order to buy another small bottle. It wasn’t particularly expensive and it wasn’t a designer brand, but each whiff of the woodsy fragrance seemed to settle Draco, reminded him that once he had loved and been loved, and he took his comforts where he could find them. </p>
<p>He greeted the doorman at the entrance to his building with a quick nod, which the man in his formal green livery solemnly returned and then held the door open for him. Draco entered and was immediately engulfed in warmth from the large fireplaces along the far wall, the scent of the dark leather furniture, and the ambiance of the dark wood paneled walls. The intent had been to create an atmosphere of wealth and permanence, and Draco knew that they had succeeded. </p>
<p>“Good morning, Mr. Malfoy,” several people murmured as he passed, and Draco nodded to them politely, acknowledging their greetings with a slight angling of his head. He approached his private lift to the penthouse offices and pressed the button, waiting patiently, his back to the room. When the doors slid silently open, he entered it and turned as the doors closed, grateful for that moment not to be under anyone’s scrutiny. He knew that as the President and CEO of the vast Conglomerate, his presence was of immediate interest to everyone in the building; he was their boss, after all. But there were times, especially when he was feeling a bit shaky, that he found the constant press of attention wearying. When the doors of the lift slid open to reveal the reception area outside of his own office, he steeled himself to be watched yet again as he crossed the hunter green carpeting that led to his assistant’s desk just outside of his offices doors.</p>
<p>“Good Morning, Harper,” he said softly, greeting the young man who had been his assistant for nearly four years. Hamilton Harper had graduated from Hogwarts at the top in his years Ravenclaw class, and had come to be invaluable. </p>
<p>“Good Morning, sir,” he answered politely, standing immediately and handing Draco a stack of correspondence and memos that had been sitting near his right elbow, pre-sorted and waiting for him to arrive. He knew that the things that didn’t need his attention had already been efficiently dealt with, and that what he was being handed was what his assistant had deemed important. He saw a copy of the Daily Prophet neatly folded on the bottom of the stack, and closed his eyes for a moment before shifting it from beneath the pile and slipping it into his other hand, holding it out. </p>
<p>“I won’t be requiring the paper today, Harper,” Draco said, fighting to keep his voice from sounding stiff but not managing. It was a sign of how professional Harper was that he merely nodded and took the paper from the outstretched hand without comment. Draco took the morning paper every day, at least to check the business pages and to see how their stocks were fairing on the Wizards Exchange; for him to refuse it was a true change of routine. The fact that Harper merely nodded politely was re-enforcement of Draco’s high opinion of him.</p>
<p>“Shall I check the stocks and see if there is anything of interest in the business pages, sir?” he asked mildly. Draco nodded, not sure he’d been able to hide his relief. </p>
<p>“That would be excellent,” he answered.</p>
<p>“Your tea is already inside, sir.” Harper moved ahead of him and put his hand on the elaborate brass doorknob. “And your son stopped by a few minutes ago. He said he’d like a few minutes this morning, if you can spare them.”</p>
<p>“I can always spare a few minutes for Scorpius,” Draco answered, his mouth softening slightly at the corners. “Tell him to come up at his convenience.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p>Draco entered his ‘inner sanctum’ and heard the door close at his back with a soft sigh of relief. Here, in this room that he’d designed himself, he was protected from the searching eyes of others and the expectations of his staff. He unbuttoned and slipped out of the over coat, hanging it on a coat tree just inside of the massive doors, and began to remove the scarf, but thought better of it and left it draped around his throat. Crossing over the thick carpeting, he approached the two large leather arm chairs that faced a black marble fireplace, a fire burning cheerfully within the grate, a low occasional table with a full tea service between the two elegant chairs. He sat in the one on the right and watched as the service sprang to life, the pot lifting, pouring a stream of the steaming rich brown liquid into a delicate bone china cup, two cubes lifting from a small sugar bowl to drop into the tea. A slender silver spoon lifted of its own volition and stirred the sugar until it was dissolved, and then a thin sliver of lemon lifted from another plate, drifting down to float softly on the surface of the hot beverage. Draco watched the process idly, thinking perhaps it was time for Harper to have another pay increase. The man was invaluable.</p>
<p>Draco finished his tea, and the moment he laid his cup in the saucer, the entirety of the service disappeared. He retrieved the stack of correspondence he’d yet to look at and crossed to his desk, taking a seat behind it, laying the mail on the blotter and was about to reach for the memo on the top when his eyes fell on his center desk drawer, and lingered. Anyone watching would have seen the way his usually light eyes clouded, the way his lips dipped down slightly at the corners. He paused in the motion of reaching towards the mail and his hand dropped to open the drawer instead.</p>
<p>The contents were organized in an almost painfully neat manner. Quills to the left, parchment neatly stacked at the center, the Malfoy Conglomerate logo embossed in the center near the bottom. There was a sharpened knife to the left for trimming his quills, and several glass bottles of ink in assorted colors lined neatly next to the parchment. But Draco ignored all of this. His eyes went immediately to a small hook on the far right side of the drawer from which dangled a very small golden key. His hand trembled only slightly when he reached for it, and it felt cool in his fingers. </p>
<p>He closed the middle drawer with a nearly silent slide and turned his head, glancing beneath it and to the left near his knee. If one did not know where to search, the small lock was all but undetectable; the gold face plate was such a near match for the golden oak wood that it performed a sort of unintentional camouflage. But Draco did know where to look, and he reached forward and fitted the tiny key in the lock and turned it. There was a short pause and then a decisive ‘click’, and a door, no more than five inches square, popped open. Draco slipped his fingers inside and felt around until he encountered what he’d known was secreted there; a thick square of parchment. Swallowing heavily, he withdrew it and held it in his hands.</p>
<p>It was smudged around the square edges, age and nearly two decades of finger prints staining the once ivory parchment a dirty yellowish beige. The edges were particularly dirty, the result of it being handled, folded and unfolded literally hundreds of times. At first, Draco had looked at it nearly every day; now, there were four or five times a year when he took it from its hiding place and held it in his hands. He opened it each Christmas Eve and even knowing that it was sentimentality at its worst, each Valentine’s Day. He opened it on his birthday, June the fifth, and on July thirty first. And he opened it on May fifth. Every year on May the fifth, as soon as he finished his tea, he opened this letter; it marked the day that it had all ended, the day that everything had changed. As he held the parchment in his hands, he closed his eyes, and he allowed himself to remember…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first time he’d ever seen the letter had been May the seventh, two thousand and nine. He was just one month shy of his twenty-ninth birthday and he’d been in the intensive care unit at St. Mungo’s for nearly forty-eight hours. The hex that had sliced his thigh muscle to the bone had been a particularly dark one and the healers had been having a terrible time controlling the bleeding and regenerating the tissue. They’d been giving him strong pain and sleeping potions, because the pain in his leg was enormous, but nothing compared to the pain that was lacerating his heart. When he was awake he could only stare comatose at the ceiling, remembering the flash of green, the swirl of black wool as he fell, the staring, unseeing green eyes that he’d glimpsed for just a moment. But sleep was almost worse, for in his drug altered dreams he managed to get to Harry in time, to pull him to safety, and it was so much more painful when he awoke and knew that this time, sleep was the respite and reality the nightmare. </p>
<p>He’d been drifting in that drug induced haze and had been wakened by the fierce pounding pain radiating from his thigh into his hip. He had reached for the bell pull that summoned the nurse when he realized that he was not in his room alone. There was someone seated by his bed and it wasn’t his mother, who had kept a near constant vigil, or his wife, who at that point, much to her future embarrassment, was still in love with him. No, seated in the stiff white hospital chair, brown eyes deadened and cheeks hollowed by grief and lack of sleep, was the last person Draco had ever expected to turn up in his hospital room. Her brilliant auburn hair was pulled back from her face and her slender, almost coltish body was swathed in a truly unfortunate black polyester pantsuit, but the face he found himself looking into was unmistakably that of Ginevra Weasley-Potter. She was staring at him, pale hands white-knuckled on the black bag in her lap, freckles standing out in bold relief against nearly colorless skin. They stared at each other for a tense moment, Draco’s eyes wide and his heart in his throat, her face all but expressionless, save for the lines of pain around her eyes and her mouth.</p>
<p>“They tell me that you’ll probably be at least partially crippled,” she said finally, her voice flat.  “I would tell you that I’m sorry, but I’m not.”</p>
<p>He swallowed heavily, his mouth made dry by not just the drugs in his system but by nerves as well. “I suppose you’re entitled to that,” he managed in a voice hoarse from disuse. He’d not said five words in the two days he’d been there.</p>
<p>She continued to stare for a long time, then looked down into her lap and snapped open the inexpensive black bag. He watched, half expecting her to withdraw her wand and hex him to hell, almost wishing that she would. Instead, she withdrew a square of white parchment. She held in for a moment, then, after briefly closing her eyes as if gathering her strength she laid it on the bed near his hand. “That’s actually more for you than it was for me,” she said tightly. “I don’t ever want to see it again.” She stood then and walked to the door, and her bright hair looked like a skein of satin ribbon against the austere darkness of her jacket. She paused again once her hand is on the doorknob. “Don’t for one moment think that I’m doing this out of kindness,” she said without looking back, her voice devoid of emotion. “I’m doing this because I know that what’s in that letter will tear you apart, and I want you to hurt as much as I do.” With those chilling words, she left the room. Draco could hear her heals clicking through the door as she walked away down the hall.</p>
<p>He’d stared at the square of parchment for a long time before picking it up, his hand trembling. When he turned it over and saw the writing on the other side, he winced reflexively. In Harry’s messy, hurried writing was one word; Ginny. Just seeing it made something in Draco’s chest begin to ache. </p>
<p>He almost hadn’t opened it. There had been times when he’d wished that he hadn’t. But as he sat in his opulent office nineteen years later he knew he’d never have been able to rest if he hadn’t read it. His hands were trembling again as he opened it now; he didn’t know why this year was so much harder than the others had been, but it was. For some reason the hurt felt new again, and raw, and when he looked down onto the page with its messy lines of equally messy writing, his throat was already beginning to feel tight.</p>
<p><i>“Gin,”</i> it began.</p>
<p>
  <i>“I know that you’re angry with me, and I suppose I understand. If our situation were reversed, I’d be plenty hacked off, too. And I know that angry doesn’t really begin to cover it. I know that you feel hurt, and betrayed, and… disappointed, and all I can say in response to that is: I know. I know, and I’m sorry.</i>
</p>
<p><i>“The words probably sound pretty hollow; just know that I mean them. I never meant for this to happen. I know that every man who’s ever cheated on his wife has said the same thing, but for me, it’s really true. I love you, Ginny.”</i> </p>
<p>Draco swallowed hard there. That line was never easy for him to read. </p>
<p>
  <i>“I love you, and I adore the kids, and I never meant to hurt any of you. Part of me wishes that this had never happened, that we could go back to being what we were, feeling what we felt when we were kids. But I know that can’t be, not now. Not anymore.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“I never meant to fall in love with someone other than you. My life was set; I had my job, and you, and the kids, and I thought that was what I wanted. But I can't lie to you, Gin, and I won't lie to myself any more. It wasn’t enough and it hadn’t been for a very long time. I think I ignored it because I didn’t want to face it, didn’t want for there to be one more thing about me that was… different, and weird. There had already been so much. And I grew up listening to my Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, going on about the ‘unnatural freaks’ on the telly, and I was already that to them. I didn’t need to add… And then there was Dudley. He’d called me queer almost from the moment I was old enough to understand; I couldn’t give him the satisfaction of knowing that it might be true. I didn’t want it to be true. I wanted to be… normal, I guess, just in this one thing.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“But I’ve learned something, Gin. I’ve learned that you can’t pretend to be something that you aren’t. That eventually, it catches up with you. That you are what you are, and the longer you go on trying to ignore it, the more miserable you become. I’ve been miserable for a long time. And if you’ll be honest with yourself, you have been, too. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Please don’t blame Draco for this. I know that temper of yours, but this isn’t his fault. It isn’t his fault that I fell in love with him. It isn’t his fault that I can’t imagine my life without him. And it isn’t his fault that I need him, like I need air, and water, and food. So, hate me, if it makes you feel better, but understand that I pursued him, that I started this, and that I can only hope that I mean half as much to him as he means to me….” </i>

  <i>"I need him, Ginny, and I refuse to go on pretending that I don’t." </i>
</p>
<p>He never did get much further than that. That was the point at which he’d find himself blinded by tears and be unable to go on. Ginevra Weasley had known just exactly what she was doing by giving him that letter; it was like a knife to the heart every time. And five times a year, he opened it, and read it, and the wounds were opened all over again.</p>
<p>He swallowed heavily, carefully refolding the parchment, but he didn’t lean forward to put it away as quickly as he usually did. He held it, knowing that this was the last thing that Harry had ever written, because it was just the next day…</p>
<p>The magical intercom on his desk sounded with a soft bell-tone, and Draco put the letter on his thigh and then quickly dashed at the dampness on his cheeks before leaning forward to press a brass button on the top. An image of Hamilton slowly manifested above the small wooden box, face a carefully professional mask.</p>
<p>“Yes, Harper,” he said, striving to make his voice sound as normal as possible. Instead, it came out sounding a bit clipped, and the visage of his assistant blinked.</p>
<p>“So sorry to intrude, sir,” he said quickly. Draco sighed silently and clenched his fists for a moment on his slender thighs. The parchment pressed into his right wrist.</p>
<p>“You aren’t intruding,” he said, intentionally softening his voice. “What did you want?”</p>
<p>“Your son is here to see you, sir.” </p>
<p>Draco nodded. “Send him in.”</p>
<p>The image of Harper nodded and faded away.</p>

  <p>REMEMBERED FIRE</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>Draco leaned forward then, secreting the letter in its hiding place, turning the key just as the door to the outer office opened. He straightened and felt his heart lift in his chest a little as his son strode into his office, closing the door quietly behind him. </p>
<p>He was so handsome, Draco thought not for the first time. Taller than he was, hair the same white blond, his sharp features softened by his mother’s genes. Scorpius’ eyes were brown, like Astoria’s, and he had a square rather than pointed chin. At twenty-two, he was tall and lean and Draco thought much better looking than he had ever been, and by far a better person. He was wearing a navy blue suit and bluish-grey silk shirt and tie, affecting his father’s preference for Muggle clothing. Draco stood as his son crossed to him and attempted a smile, but Scorpius wasn’t fooled; he never had been. He studied his father’s reddened eyes with an expression of both regret and understanding, reaching out with his hand. Draco took it to shake it, but Scorpius wrapped his other hand over the top and held it cushioned between his warm palms. </p>
<p>“Good morning, Father,” he said softly, squeezing the hand that Draco had not realized was cold until it was cocooned in warmth. </p>
<p>“Good morning, son,” Draco responded. “How are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, sir,” his son answered. “Better than you are, I’d wager.”</p>
<p>Draco damped his lips with his tongue. Scorpius was also far more direct than he had ever been. “I’m all right,” he said softly, and Scorpius did not argue with him, but he obviously didn’t believe him, either.</p>
<p>Scorpius had found out about his father’s ‘indiscretion’ when he’d been fifteen. His mother, who had once loved his father with everything in her, had found the very letter that Draco had just secreted in his desk, and he’d been fortunate in catching her reading it, for he’d been sure she would have burned it otherwise. Draco had kept it from her for over a decade. She’d had her suspicions, for he never went to her bed any longer and he kept his distance emotionally, but word of his affair with Harry Potter had never leaked beyond Harry’s inner circle. Ron knew, and he had hated Draco for so long that his reaction wasn’t unexpected. He’d hated it, hated that Harry was cheating on Ginny, but he never abandoned his friendship with Harry. Hermione had known as well but had seemed almost unsurprised at the time by the developing relationship between the two Aurors. After Harry’s death, she had been a kind and compassionate island of calm in Draco’s shattered existence, and still remained a good friend. Ginny had never told a soul and remained in the eyes of the wizarding world Harry Potter’s tragic widow. </p>
<p>Upon finding the letter, Astoria had flown into a rage. Draco had rescued it, but his marriage had been irreparably damaged. Astoria had promptly told their son that his father was a faithless, twisted degenerate. Fortunately for Draco, Scorpius had not believed her, but he had asked hard questions. </p>
<p>Draco was certain that the most painful conversation he’d ever had in his adult life had been the one telling his son that he’d been unfaithful to his mother… with another man. He would never understand what kind providence had smiled on him enough in that dark time, because Scorpius had been disappointed, but his love for his father had never wavered. In fact, if anything, it had brought them closer. And he would never know what Narcissa had said to his wife, but somehow, someway, Astoria had not gone to the press, had not told her parents, and had never directly said another word about it to him. Of course, that didn’t prevent her from being an unhappy shrew who made snide remarks and cheerfully spent as much of his money as she could get her hands on, but he thought that a small price to pay for not seeing his name on the front page of the <i>Prophet</i>, and for Harry’s memory to remain untarnished.</p>
<p>Scorpius squeezed his hand before releasing it and taking half a step back.</p>
<p>“I’ve come to speak with you about something,” he said with a determination that Draco recognized, and he gestured towards one of the two chairs before his desk before sitting gracefully in the other. He would never sit behind his desk and force his son to stand before him, as if he were some sort of subject summoned before his throne. He’d been raised that way. Being called before his father’s desk in his austere study had been an occasion for terror; he’d never make his son feel less than he was, never. </p>
<p>“What’s on your mind?” Draco asked, crossing his long legs as gracefully as the stiffness in his right thigh would allow.</p>
<p>“I saw Mrs. Weasley this morning,” Scorpius began, plucking at the knife edge pleat in his dark trousers. Draco waited and watched his son’s face as he seemed to pick his words carefully. “She asked me to intercede with you on her behalf.”</p>
<p>Draco sighed inwardly. He knew what this was about, and he’d already told Hermione that he wasn’t interested.</p>
<p>“If this is about the American's…”</p>
<p>“Father,” Scorpius said, brown eyes lifting to his own. “Before you say no, please listen to me.”</p>
<p>He looked so earnest, and sounded so serious that Draco subsided with a slight nod, even as he felt a flicker of irritation at Under Deputy Secretary Weasley. </p>
<p>“The situation has become… more serious,” he said. “There is definitely something going on, something dark, and the people in power fear they may have a very similar problem to the one that we had, all those years ago.”</p>
<p>Draco didn’t need explanations for his son’s enigmatic words to know what he was referring to.</p>
<p>“They think they have a Dark Lord?” he asked a bit wryly.</p>
<p>“They think that they have the potential for one,” Scorpius clarified. “And frankly, they feel a bit in the weeds. They’ve never dealt with anything like this before, and they are desperate for a consultant.”</p>
<p>Draco pursed his lips. “Why doesn’t she send her husband?” he asked softly. “He spent years fighting the last Dark Lord; he was the right hand of the man who defeated him. I was merely…”</p>
<p>“A Death Eater,” Scorpius said, not unkindly, but firmly. “And an Auror.”</p>
<p>Draco leaned back in the chair and studied his son’s solemn face, fighting to keep his own expressionless. Scorpius held his gaze but Draco saw the anxiety in his eyes; his son knew that this was a subject that was all but forbidden. </p>
<p>“You must admit, it gives you a unique perspective, sir,” the younger man went on when his father remained silent. “You were the only one who was part of Tom Riddle’s inner circle, then changed sides.”</p>
<p>“I was not part of the inner circle,” Draco said in a measured tone. “I was an observer.”</p>
<p>“Your father…” Scorpius cut himself off, and Draco knew that he’d narrowed his eyes in warning. He closed them for a moment and sighed, marshalling calm even as his hands fisted on the arms of the chair.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir.” </p>
<p>Draco swallowed heavily, and then shook his head before opening his eyes once again. When he saw the rusty stain on Scorpius’ cheeks, his only thought was to reassure his son.</p>
<p>“No, it’s all right,” he said heavily. “My father was very… intimately connected with Riddle. And I was… nearby. Often. Often enough to know that the man was a monster, and that my father was a fool.” He paused, suddenly feeling every one of his forty-eight years as he looked into his son’s young, eager face. “What is it that she wants me to do, Scorpius?” he asked, and his son leaned forward keenly.</p>
<p>“They are looking for a consultant,” he said quickly. “Someone with a background in the dark spells and magic, someone who will recognize the signs, who knows how to dismantle the dark wards…”</p>
<p>Draco held up his hand. “I will only know how to dismantle them if I recognize them, Scorpius,” he said flatly. “I highly doubt that these… dark wizards, whoever they are, are using similar magic to what was being used here.”</p>
<p>“But that’s just it, Father,” Scorpius went on. “That’s why Mrs. Weasley is so keen for it to be you. They sent her reports, scans of the wards, autopsy information on the dead. The spells are the same.” He paused meaningfully. “Exactly… the same.”</p>
<p>Draco felt a chill, like a finger of ice, slip down his spine. “The same?” he whispered. Scorpius nodded. </p>
<p>“And there’s something else. New information that just came through last night,” he went on when Draco remained quiet for a moment. Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to hear what was going to be said next, but he nodded warily for his son to continue. “It… appears that there is some… vigilantism taking place as well, someone who is fighting this dark threat, acting as a mercenary.”</p>
<p>Draco frowned. “Surely their ministry…”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” Scorpius interrupted politely. “It isn’t anyone within the American Ministry. They think he’s being financed by a private source…” He paused and dampened his lips, as if he were suddenly nervous again, brown eyes dropping to his knees.</p>
<p>“Go on, son,” Draco urged gently. Scorpius lifted his eyes to Draco’s face, and looked almost regretful.</p>
<p>“They’ve been able to trace the magical signature left by the mercenary’s wand.” Again that chill slid over Draco’s skin as he studied his son’s furrowed brow. </p>
<p>“It’s Potter’s, sir.”</p>
<p>Blood rushed instantly into Draco’s ears as it leached from his face, and he felt his heart slam into the inside of his ribs.</p>
<p>“Potter’s… what?” he wheezed. He was suddenly cold, so very, very cold. Scorpius leaned forward and placed his hand on Draco’s knee, and that was the first moment that he realized that it was shaking.</p>
<p>“Potter’s wand. Father, someone has found and is using Harry Potter’s wand.”</p>
<p>And Draco knew it that moment that there was no longer any need for discussion. He was going to America.<br/>*******</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had discovered years previous that international Portkeys were not something he could suffer in comfort. The time ‘in flight’ was considerably longer than domestic Portkey, and when he landed his leg was always numb and collapsed under his weight leaving him in an ungainly sprawl, his dignity in tatters. At some point in his thirties he’d allowed his mother to talk him into trying the Muggle method of intercontinental flight, and had found first class travel surprisingly relaxing. </p>
<p>But as he settled into his first class berth in the British Airways sumptuous jet, after checking his black wool overcoat with the handsome flight attendant and he’d been delivered the requested snifter of Cognac, he knew that this flight would be neither relaxing, nor pleasant. He was too wound up, too edgy and tense. The information his son had given him had been extremely disturbing; the information he’d gotten from Hermione Granger-Weasley had been even more so.</p>
<p>He’d left the Malfoy Building and walked the four blocks to the Ministry almost as soon as Scorpius had left, and Hermione Weasley had had him admitted to her office almost immediately. Her brown eyes had been shadowed with the bruises of many sleepless nights, and red-rimmed with fatigue. She’d offered him coffee and a chair, and then showed him what she had. </p>
<p>He’d gone through the reports from the American Ministry while she had sipped a cup of coffee, each new page increasing his anxiety. When he was on the last report, he’d looked up to find her watching him carefully.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible,” he’d wheezed.</p>
<p>She’d shaken her head emphatically.</p>
<p>“It isn’t,” she’d said. “Someone has his wand, Draco. There’s no doubt about it. Now the only question is; where did they get it?”</p>
<p>One of the details that the wizarding public at large did not know about the death of Harry Potter was that by the time that Weasley had deposited Draco at St. Mungo’s and had gotten back to the scene, Harry’s body and his wand were gone. They had disappeared without a trace. Fearing that dark wizards had somehow taken the body in order to either desecrate it, or to somehow re-animate it as an Inferi, there had been a secret yet frantic search for the remains that had gone on for months. An empty coffin had been buried at the funeral, a replica of his eleven inch holly wand presented to his widow. </p>
<p>Draco knew he would never forget standing at the back of the crowd at the somber memorial, held up by his mother on one side and his unsuspecting wife on the other, his heart as empty as the ivory coffin that he watched lowered into the ground. The throbbing pain in his leg had been a solace that day. The pain had kept him centered, and his mother’s hand firm in his had allowed him to hang onto his composure. He’d known that she knew about Harry: she’d never said a word, but he’d seen it in her sad, wintry gray eyes, and she’d been the pillar he needed when his own resolve was in tatters.</p>
<p>The fact that both the body of Harry Potter and his wand had never been found was one of the Ministry of Magic’s best kept secrets. When months, then years had gone by without a trace of it being discovered, the search had finally dwindled away. There had never been even so much as a breath of a rumor to lead them to believe that anyone was holding the body or the wand, or knew of their whereabouts. It was one of the great mysteries of the age, known only to Draco, Hermione, Ron, Harry’s widow, and the upper members of the Wizengamot. </p>
<p>He listened to the soft roar of the jet’s large engines as the plane taxied on the runway, eyes staring out at the bleak, windswept emptiness of the tarmac, but he was seeing in his mind’s eye that long past day; the crowd dressed in black, the dark, ominous clouds over head. Ginny Potter with her three small children standing bravely near the casket; red-headed James, the strawberry blonde baby in her arms, and little Albus, the same age as Scorpius, green eyes wide with confusion. He’d felt drawn to the small replica of Harry and yet he’d kept his distance from him, from them all. He couldn’t look into those eyes, couldn’t speak to the widow, couldn’t bring himself to pay his respects to the family. Ginny might be burying her husband, but he’d lost his reason for living. </p>
<p>The only thing that had kept him sane was Scorpius. </p>
<p>Scorpius had needed him. He’d told himself that every day, multiple times a day. Scorpius needed him, his mother needed him. And so he lived his life, such as it was. Never, in the nineteen years since that night, had there been a trace of evidence that Harry and his wand weren’t gone forever. <br/>Until the day before. And Hermione knew that it was the only thing that would get him on a plane to Charleston, South Carolina, of all places.</p>
<p>“Draco, please,” she’d implored. “Someone has his wand. Can we really let them just… continue to use it, without knowing who it is, and how they got it?” She’d stared at him, brown eyes wide and face pale. “Draco, please,” she’d whispered again. “They might know where he is…” She’d teared up then, and he’d been lost. </p>
<p>She’d been right, of course. He couldn’t just ignore it. He couldn’t rest, not until he knew for certain. Not until he’d seen the evidence himself. Hence, his place in the first class compartment of the airplane. And as the plane lifted into the cloudy sky, he drained the expensive cognac from the snifter in his hand and wished the heat he felt spreading through his stomach would take the edge off of his anxiety. He’d not slept more than two hours the night before, and he was so tired…</p>
<p>The purr of the large jet engines and the expensive alcohol finally combined their forces, and Draco’s sleep deprived body gave up the fight with scarcely a whimper. His eyes drifted closed and his head listed to the side, and he was blissfully unaware of the young steward, who gently removed the empty glass from his lax fingers and covered him with a soft cashmere throw.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <i>There was mist. Thick, heavy mist, and it smelled of the damp and felt cool and wet against his face.  It was very dark, only shadows to mark his path, but he moved forward anyway, surging ahead, moving towards…</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>What? He didn’t know. He only knew that he had to keep moving, that it was imperative that he get to his destination. That nothing had ever been as important as arriving where he was going.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>And then he was cloaked in warmth, sweet, seductive, soft against his face like a lover’s hair, moving through his vines like heady wine.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Draco,” a dark voice whispered gently against his ear. The sound of it ignited fires he’d thought banked forever even as his heart surged almost painfully with joy.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Oh,” he heard himself sob even as his hands closed over strong shoulders and he felt himself engulfed in a fierce embrace. “Oh, it’s you. My God…” Tears stung his eyes even as he was lowered to a soft surface, as his body was skimmed by steady, sure hands, as lips and tongue mapped the arch of his throat. He arched his neck and wrapped his long legs around narrow hips.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Please,” he begged, hands finding and fisting in a wealth of soft, thick hair. “Please. It’s been so long…”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Be sure,” the dusky voice cautioned even as he felt first one, then a second finger slide slickly into the clinging heat of his body. He gasped and arched as the internal burn faded, replaced by the wonder of being skillfully prepared once again. It had been years… “Be very sure. There is no going back…”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“I’m sure,” he gasped, his body reacting forcefully to the pleasure. “Please, God. I’m sure!”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>The hand that fisted in his hair was something less than gentle, and his head was yanked back and to the side. “Touch yourself,” the voice instructed silkily, even as a tongue wetly mapped the throbbing pulse point under his chin. Sweet languor filled him, his nipples contracted so swiftly and completely that it was slightly painful, his breath struggled in his throat even as his erection throbbed, dripping drops of pearly pre-come onto his flat belly. Gently, a hand closed around his and curled his fingers around his cock, and it jerked desperately in Draco’s palm.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“I love you,” the voice whispered against his throat. “I’ve loved you for so long, I will always love you. Remember that. Always…” </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>The words sent a rush of relief through him, relief accompanied by the most profound joy. Tears slipped from his eyes, and when he felt a blunt hardness press against the tight furl of his opening, he bore down, trying to ease the way, to force the muscles to accept what had so long been denied him…</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>He felt the burn of entry just as another sharp pain shot through his throat, and he arched and gasped as he realized what it was, what was happening… But then the jolt in his pulse and the pain of possession were swept away on a surge of the most profound ecstasy…</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Harry!” he sobbed, just as cogent thought was lost…</i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sir? Sir? Wake up, sir.”</p>
<p>Draco started and blinked, staring up into the concerned face above his. For a panicked moment he had no idea where he was, or who the face belonged to, and his pulse, which was still racing, jerked uncomfortably. But then he felt the subtle vibration of the plane, heard the dull roar of the engines, and recognized the young face looking into his with worry. The flight attendant, the one who’d been so solicitous earlier, was leaning over him, his hand warm on his shoulder, blue eyes searching his face. That was when Draco realized that he was crying; that there were tears in his eyes and on his cheeks, and that he was almost painfully aroused. He glanced down in alarm, feeling relief when he saw that someone, probably the young man leaning over him, had covered him with a soft blanket and that it effectively hid the evidence of his bodies reaction to his dream.</p>
<p>“Sir, are you all right?”</p>
<p>Draco blinked again, reaching up to dash at the tears on his face with hands that weren’t steady. “I’m fine,” he assured the attendant quickly. “I… bad dream…”</p>
<p>“Of course.” A hand appeared in his line of vision, holding what appeared to be a rolled up face cloth. He reached for it, and found it warm and damp when it settled into his hand. Draco quickly wiped his face with the cloth. An alarming thought occurred to him, and he looked up quickly. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t… loud, was I?” he asked, feeling his face fill with color. The sturdy body of the flight attendant was hiding his view of the other first class passengers, but he realized with a surge of gratitude that it was also hiding their view of him.</p>
<p>“No,” the man, whose name badge read ‘Drew’, assured him kindly. “I just noticed that you seemed… distressed. You weren’t in any way disruptive.”</p>
<p>Again, he felt relieved as he sighed and completed wiping the tears from his face. </p>
<p>“Would you care for something to drink?” Drew asked, straightening into the aisle, face now a careful mask of professionalism. “Wine, perhaps? Or tea?”</p>
<p>“Just water, thank you,” Draco answered quietly. When the young man moved away, he turned his eyes to the dark window of the plane, primarily so that he wouldn’t have to meet any curious gazes that might be turned in his direction. His head hurt even more than before and his eyes felt gritty, but the most disturbing thing was that the details of his dream, which had seemed so very vivid and important, were swiftly slipping away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>********</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco sighed heavily, letting himself into the elaborate room at the bed and breakfast where he was staying, situated in the heart of Historic Charleston’s Battery Park District. Right on the corner of two of the city’s oldest streets, facing a beautiful park and then the ocean beyond, it had once been the city residence of a wealthy rice planter who had also owned a plantation along the Ashley River, outside of town. </p>
<p>He’d been dimly aware of the politely delivered History lesson he’d received from his driver on the way in from the airport, but his head had been throbbing and he’d been exhausted. His flight from London had landed at La Guardia in New York, and there had been a two hour lay over before his next flight, in a much smaller plane, had departed for Charleston. He’d been gone from London 14 hours by the time he’d arrived in South Carolina, his leg had stiffened up until he was limping painfully with each step, and the last thing he’d wanted was to ‘see the sights’. He thought that the rolling countryside that they had passed through, driving along the scenic Ashley River, had been lovely, and he’d found himself fascinated by the tendrils of gray Spanish moss that hung from the trees, swaying in the breeze like delicate lace. But mostly, he’d wanted a stiff drink and a bed upon arriving in the Inn.</p>
<p>He had cause to be grateful once again for the efficiency of Harper when he’d arrived. The young woman who had greeted him in what had once been a sumptuous front parlor was gentility itself, wearing a simple yet elegant burgundy suit, waving a young bellman to relieve him of his luggage, escorting him to a room on the ground floor.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Mr. Malfoy. Your assistant, Mister Harper,” the lovely concierge told him as she led the way, her softly accented voice musical, “told us that stairs were a difficulty. We’ve given you a suite here on the ground floor, off of the East Portico, as there is no elevator. It used to be the Master of the House’s own bedchamber. He returned from the Civil War with a serious leg injury, and never climbed beyond the first floor in his later years.”</p>
<p>She’d opened a heavy, dark wood door and led the way into a magnificent suite. A sitting room was immediately inside the door with elaborate parquet floors and a stunning mahogany mantle over a large fireplace, surrounded by elegant period furniture upholstered in dark green velvet. She continued through the room, pointing things out as she went. “The bar is in this armoire, and in here--” she pushed opened another door, “--is the bedroom.”</p>
<p>The bed held place of prominence on the far wall, a stunningly crafted four poster with gauzy drapes tied to each post and a burgundy silk counterpane. The walls were covered in a patterned shade of deep gold and the floors were as intricately laid as the ones in the other room. She went to the wall and pulled on a velvet cord, and the dark red drapes slid back, revealing a bank of French doors that led directly to a covered veranda. “These doors face the bay, and the park,” she said as she turned, a polite smile on her face. “If you open them in the evenings, there is a lovely breeze off of the harbor. If I can get you anything else, please let me know.”</p>
<p>“It’s lovely, thank you,” he’d said sincerely, looking around the room. She spared him a slight nod as she departed, leaving him standing in the center of the bedroom, studying what could only be described as a tribute to all things Gryffindor. Sighing, he’d pulled off his overcoat, laying it over a nearby chair, removed his suit jacket and tie, and after kicking off his shoes and loosening his collar, lay down on the bed, discovering the down filled mattress with a sigh of pure hedonistic pleasure. The next thing he knew, it was full dark, and he rose groggily from the bed. When he shuffled, disheveled and achy, into the sitting room he found a covered tray on the small table before the fireplace.</p>
<p>“Mr. Malfoy,” the attached note read. “Mr. Harper said that you are fond of cheese and fruit. If you require anything more substantial, please let me know. Samantha.”</p>
<p>“Samantha?” He thought with a slight frown, and then had the vague recollection of the young woman who’d greeted him. He lifted the large silver lid, and found an elegant assortment of cheeses, biscuits and crackers, and grapes, strawberries and melon. That, in combination with a fine bottle of Chablis he found in the bar, were his supper, and he decided before retiring that it was definitely time for Harper to have that raise in pay. </p>
<p>The next morning, he breakfasted in the dining room. It was off season, and he was one of only three guests. He kept to himself and took tea and toast, and was just finishing his meal when a young man in chauffeur’s attire appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Mr. Malfoy,” he inquired politely. Draco lifted his eyes from the morning paper to find himself being studied politely. </p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I’m here to take you to your meeting with Minister Henry.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded, and followed him out to yet another limousine.</p>
<p>From there, his journey diverged from its previous Muggle course. The young man drove him to what he told him had once been a railroad station, but was now a shopping center.</p>
<p>“Enter the fourth store on the left,” his driver said politely as he held open the door. “Go to the rear of the store and enter the second changing room on the right. Pull down on the hook on the right.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded and entered the small shopping mall, found the store in question, something called “Tasty Togs”, and did as instructed. He walked past a young woman with an alarming array of facial piercings who nodded with a smirk, entering the dressing room area, finding the room as he’d been instructed. When he pulled down on the hook, the floor shuddered for a moment, and then the whole of the dressing room began to descend, like a lift headed into a basement.</p>
<p>When it stopped moving, he pulled the curtain aside, and found himself facing an atrium not unlike the one in the Ministry of Magic in London.</p>
<p>He’d been surprised when he’d first learned, years before, that the American Magical Congress, as it was known in that country, was not in New York, or even Washington DC, with the seat of their Muggle government, but in Charleston, South Carolina. When he’d questioned Hermione about it, as she seemed to know everything about everything, he hadn’t been disappointed.</p>
<p>“Well,” she said with that air of a school teacher beginning a lesson, “Charleston is one of the oldest cities in the United States, and the original Wizard’s to settle in America tended to gravitate toward the Southern States. South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana. There was a smaller settlement in New England, but we all know how that worked out for the magical population, don’t we?” One eyebrow arched ironically. Draco supposed it made a sort of sense; had he been a wizard in the late seventeenth century, he’d have stayed as far away from Salem, Massachusetts as he could, too.</p>
<p>The space outside of the elevator was bustling with activity. Along one wall were dozens of fireplaces that periodically surged to life with the familiar green fire of witches and wizards arriving by floo. He could dimly hear the percussive sound of Apparition, and on the wall to his left were dozens of lifts, queues before each of them as people went about their business.</p>
<p>“Mr. Malfoy, I presume?”</p>
<p>The slightly squeaky voice startled him, and he looked down to find a wizened house-elf smiling benignly up at him, great bat like ears alert, large green eyes wide. This elf, unlike the ones in England, was not wearing a tea towel or a toga, but a full suit of clothes, including waistcoat and tie, in a truly startling array of bright colors. </p>
<p>Draco nodded, and the elf had gestured to the side with his hand. “This way.”</p>
<p>Draco followed the small creature to a lift on the end, where there was no queue waiting. “This is the Minister’s private elevator,” the elf said by way of explanation. “It will take us directly to his office.”</p>
<p>Draco merely blinked in bemusement as he followed him inside.</p>

<p>REMEMBERED FIRE</p>
<p>Part Three</p>
<p>Minister Henry proved to be a jovial appearing man in his mid-fifties, very amiable, very grateful that Draco had dropped his own busy schedule to ‘help them with their little problem’. He had escorted Draco to the Magical Law Enforcement Department, and introduced him to the American’s counterpart to Kingsley Shacklebolt, Micah Trundeldale, Chief Inspector. His subordinates were not Aurors in America; they had the official title of Magical Enforcement Officers. He’d been greeted by Trundeldale, a harried looking man with a brusque disposition, and then shown into the room where all of the evidence had been collected. Two of the junior officers stayed with him, showing him the reports, displaying the evidence. </p>
<p>As the morning progressed into afternoon, and Draco went over each report and saw the findings, the picture had become clearer. There were survivors of the war in Britain at work in the southern part of the United States; the evidence was incontrovertible. What was also very clear, and his heart had jerked hard in his chest on first seeing the unmistakable magical signature on one of the dead, was that someone was utilizing Harry Potter’s wand in the covert war against the new forces of darkness.</p>
<p>“It’s not that we don’t appreciate the help,” Officer Edwards had said a bit wryly as Draco studied the wizard photos of one of the victims. This one had been decapitated, and the lingering signature of the use of Harry’s wand hovered over the body if one knew what to look for. Draco did. “But we’d like to take these people into custody and have them stand trial.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the whole ‘fairness under the law’ doctrine set down in your Constitution,” Draco said with a slight smirk as he studied the photograph. “Applies even under Wizard law, does it?” The young man had colored slightly.</p>
<p>“Well, there is that,” he said. “But if we can’t question them, we have no idea who’s behind the whole thing.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps the holder of the wand knows who is behind it,” Draco had mused quietly, moving to the next photo. This time, the victim had been neatly beheaded as well, a very clean, surgical kill, and after wincing a bit, Draco had leaned closer, studying the photo, his attention caught by something on the throat just below where the head had been removed from the shoulders. He pulled his own wand from his sleeve and waved it over the photo, muttering <i>“Engorgio”</i>. Immediately, the photo expanded in size, and Draco studied it for another moment, and then lifted his eyes to the two officers with him.</p>
<p>“You fellows missed something,” he said without condemnation. Immediately they both leaned closer to where he was pointing.</p>
<p>“Son of a bitch,” the first one breathed. “We did miss that.”</p>
<p>“You may want to go back and study the other photos. If that is present on all of your victims, then you have something very different at work here.”</p>
<p>That had been hours before, and as he closed the door to his suite and crossed to one of the two large arm chairs to collapse into it with a heavy sigh, he found himself torn. He’d really had no choice but to come; the evidence of Harry’s wand was everywhere. But the American’s had more than just a burgeoning group of Death Eaters to deal with. This group, apparently, was made up exclusively of vampires. What Draco had spotted on the throat of one vigilante victim after another was the tell-tale scarring left when a vampire was ‘turned’, the two perfect puncture wounds, round and white against the skin over the jugular.</p>
<p>Draco had had several experiences since the war with Vampires, and while part of him sympathized with their plight, he found their whole make-up faintly disturbing. These were not like other magical creatures; they had once been men and women with families, lives. Through no fault of their own in most cases, they were now no longer human but something else, not quite alive and yet not dead, not human and yet not a creature in the way a centaur or an elf was. They were similar in some ways to werewolves, and yet not that either. They could still masquerade as men regardless of the cycle of the moon, and that made them confounding… and dangerous. </p>
<p>In most cases their condition had also rendered them supernaturally beautiful; it was part of their state as well. As with all predators, whatever force of nature it was that had created them had also imbued them with what they needed to hunt successfully. Birds of prey had keen eyesight and talon like claws, big cats had stealth and speed. Vampires had the ability to seduce their victims with a look, a word, a scent. They had the facility to make them malleable with a touch, and transport them to heights of ecstasy while draining their life blood from their veins. The whole of their existence was about seduction and survival, and loathe as he was to admit it, they had always faintly fascinated Draco. Even during investigations, he kept his distance from them. Something inside of him had told him that he was one of those who would be susceptible to their allure, and so he’d always been very careful to keep his distance, and to avoid eye contact when in their presence. And they sensed that about him, he feared. There had been that one, just before Harry had died, that they’d brought in for questioning. What was his name again? Something French. </p>
<p>Henri? No, that wasn’t right. Oh, yes. Hermes. Hermes Gautlier. </p>
<p>He rubbed his hands over his face as his mind went back to the case, and to the night they’d been questioning Gautlier. Veritaserum was not effective on Vampires, so they’d had no idea if anything he’d been telling them had been the truth, and his faintly superior attitude had infuriated Draco even as he’d been drawn to the man’s dark-haired, dark-eyed beauty.</p>
<p>His face had been all strong planes and angles, his eyes liquid brown, his black hair hanging to just past his shoulder blades. He’d been dressed impeccably, from his Armani suit to his Prada boots, and he’d worn a blood red ruby stick pin in his tie and a huge signet ring with the same color stone on the index finger of his left hand. “As an inside joke,” he’d said with a rakish charm. He’d been supercilious, and snide, and completely uncooperative, and even so, Draco had felt drawn to him and Gautlier, damn his soulless existence to hell, had known it. The shrewd smirks he’d sent Draco’s way all evening had been unsettling. Only one thing had gotten to Hermes Gautlier; and that had been the complete icy indifference of Auror Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Draco watched in fascination as Gautlier turned his seductive power on Harry full force, and Harry merely eyed him indifferently. It had been intriguing to watch; the vampire, trying all of his seductive wiles to distract the young Auror; the Auror, impervious, unimpressed, undeterred. Harry was not affected during the entire three hours they questioned the vampire before being forced to release him for lack of evidence, and Draco, by simply watching, was as aroused as he’d ever been in his life. He all but attacked Harry the moment they were alone, and been eternally grateful when his lover didn’t question him about the source of his sudden need to be taken against a wall. Three weeks later, Harry was dead, and he’d not thought of Gautlier in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>He rubbed that back of his neck with a slightly unsteady hand. At the end of the day, the only conclusion that he’d been able to reach was that there was, in fact, an underground movement at work in the southern United States, populated by wizards very familiar with the dark work of Lord Voldemort. Many of the attacks and spells that had been used against an unsuspecting Muggle population Draco had seen before. There were Muggle families that had been attacked, the dead all bearing signs of the Avadra Kedavra, Muggle authorities baffled by the complete lack of any evidence of violence. A bridge had fallen, government officials had been attacked and killed; Draco had seen it all before, at the beginning of their war against darkness. But there was clearly something else at work here, too. Disappearances within the Magical population of people who had been outspoken proponents of the same pure-blood mania as he’d seen in the beginning with Voldemort, just as the ranks of newly minted ‘Death Eaters’ appeared to be growing. Draco had a sinking suspicion that there was a Vampire cult at work in the situation, with one central figure who fancied himself the ‘new Voldemort’, stalking and turning those of a like mind in an attempt to create an Army that was swift, fast, preternaturally strong, and almost indestructible. The very thought of it was terrifying.</p>
<p>Then, on top of that, there was this vigilante out there, using Harry’s wand, destroying these creatures, sometimes at a rate of two of three victims a day. Draco sighed again and rubbed his hand over his weary face. He still had no idea who could possibly have the wand, where they’d gotten it, and how that had any connection with the disappearance of Harry’s body. With a soft groan, knowing sitting there and going back over it in his mind wasn’t going to help and would most probably just keep him awake, he stood and took a bottle of wine out of the secreted bar and went to his luggage to find a dreamless sleep potion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <i>He was running through the mist. It had been years since he’d felt the sensation of his legs pumping and his heart racing, but he felt it then... running, even though his leg throbbed and his lungs screamed, and terror streaked the length of his spine…</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>When a hard hand shot out of the darkness and grabbed him, he shrieked inelegantly and tried to jerk his arm away, but the grip was too firm, bruising his arm, shoving his back against a hard surface. He was naked… why was he naked? </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Don’t run, Draco,” the voice whispered against his ear, and this time it sounded desperate even as the hot breath brushed against his face, his ear. “Don’t run, not from me…”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“But it’s not you,” he said, his body shuddering as lips touched his jaw, glided to his throat. Draco’s heart pounded beneath his breast bone as if it were trying to escape. “It isn’t you, not anymore…”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“But it is,” the voice entreated. “Look at me, Draco. It is.”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Draco shook his head even as he was compelled by hard hands that gripped the sides of his head to look into the face that floated into his line of vision, the face that had haunted his dreams for years. He saw the hard cheekbones, the square, slightly cleft jaw, the straight nose. The glasses were gone, but the eyes were just the same; green as grass, lit as if from within, framed by thick black lashes and topped by brows the shape of a raven’s spread wings. Those eyes, his eyes…</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Oh, God,” he sobbed roughly. “Oh, God…” </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“You see, it is me,” Harry said gently, his hand easing along the line of Draco’s jaw. “It is me.”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Draco felt himself lifted then by an eerily strong arm and his legs flailed for a moment before they lifted and locked around a firm waist. He felt the arm around his back tighten even as a blunt shape pressed against the most vulnerable part of him. “Oh, please,” he whimpered, hands scrambling up the long line of a muscular back. The skin beneath his palms was smooth, and cool, like marble. “Please…”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>And then he was crying out as he was breached without warning or preparation, and his body bowed against the twin assaults of pain and pleasure. He felt the lips at his throat, felt the tongue touch his skin…</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“I need you, Draco,” the mouth said against his neck. “I need you…”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>He sank his hands into the thick wealth of black hair and hung on as hard thrusts drove him up the wall and angled his head to the side in silent supplication, even as he knew that it was wrong, that what was possessing him was not the man he’d loved. He felt the sharp fangs brush his skin, find the pulse point and pierce easily into his vein, and sweeping pleasure roared over the flushed surface of his skin. Where he’d not even been hard moments before, orgasm was streaking the length of his spine and exploding in a burning rush between their heaving bodies, painting their stomachs with his release even as a the low growl sounded against his throat. He felt himself begin to go cold…felt his heart begin to struggle even as he held on tight and found himself welcoming the return of the darkness…</i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He surged up in the bed, heart hammering in his throat, body drenched in sweat. He sat in the middle of the massive four-poster, staring frantically around the sumptuous room and trying desperately to get his bearings. It took a few moments for him to recognize where he was; that he was in his room at the bed and breakfast and that once again he’d wakened from a nightmare. He swallowed heavily, pushing at the hair that had fallen over his eyes, and looked to the side at the lighted image on the Muggle digital clock next to the bed. 12:27, it read and Draco covered his face with his hand. 12:27. It had been years since he’d been wakened by night terrors at 12:27, years since the significance of the time had made his heart ache and his eyes burn. He’d read it on every report of that night that had been written; Time of death: 12:27. </p>
<p>Sighing heavily, he swung his legs over the side of the bed, becoming aware in that instance that the inside of his silk pajama bottoms was sticky. He paused, eyes opening wide as he stared down at the dark stain at his own groin. Good heavens, it had been years since he’d had a wet dream. What the hell? And then his brow furrowed, and he stared at the vial on his night stand. He reached over and picked it up, just to be sure, and saw that it was empty. He’d taken the dreamless sleep potion, so why was he dreaming? If he’d bought it from an apothecary he might think it had been the ingredients, but he’d brewed that one himself. Thoughtfully placing the empty vial back on the nightstand, he stood, pausing a moment to allow his leg to stabilize beneath him, then crossed to his luggage to take out new pajama’s.</p>
<p>A cleaning spell and fresh pajama bottoms later, he was headed back towards the bed when he realized that the room felt close, and stuffy. Detouring to the windows, he took hold of the pull and opened the drapes enough to reveal one set of doors, and bright moonlight flooded into the room. He unlocked and opened one of them and instantly a cool breeze, fragrant with the scents of flowers and the ocean, flowed over his still flushed skin. He closed his eyes and let the cool air waft over him, then opened them and was about to turn when something out in the garden caught his eye. He stopped, leaning forward to look more carefully.</p>
<p>A chill ran the length of his spine and he stiffened on a harshly drawn breath. Someone was standing in the middle of the garden, about thirty feet away, staring at the Inn. No, he amended in his mind; not at the Inn, at the porch, and through the porch, at him. He started to step back instinctively, but then the figure moved slightly and moonlight splashed across broad shoulders encased in black leather, lit the long elegant line of a sturdy leg, caught in the blue black waves of a thick head of tousled hair. </p>
<p>Draco gasped and pushed the door open, stepping out onto the porch, but by the time he reached the railing, the figure was gone, vanished as if it had never been there at all. He leaned over the wooden balustrade and searched the gardens frantically, but there was no one there.</p>
<p>Straightening, he wrapped his arms around his chest, his body shaken with a deep chill. He’d seen… what had he seen? </p>
<p>“Christ!” he muttered explosively, backing towards the doors. What the hell was wrong with him tonight?</p>
<p>Ignoring the remaining closeness in his room, he firmly closed and locked the doors and pulled the drapes closed, but it was still hours before he fell into a fitful slumber.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had not gone back to sleep until nearly six and had been awake again at seven thirty, and the headache that had lingered for days had taken up full residence behind his eyes. When he went downstairs for breakfast, he noticed Muggle law enforcement activity in the park, and paused, glancing at Samantha who stood near the doors, watching the police. </p>
<p>“Is something amiss?” he asked politely.</p>
<p>“Well, something is,” she answered. “But we’ve no idea what.” She turned back to him with her reserved smile. “Your car is waiting in the rear, whenever you’re ready.” He nodded, fetched a muffin from the table, and gone on his way.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the Ministry, the offices of Magical Law Enforcement were in an uproar; there had been another vigilante-type execution during the night. Draco’s eyes widened when he learned that the body had been found just that morning by a jogging Muggle, in the park in front of the Inn where he was staying. The Ministry now had that mess to deal with, and it took them hours to make contact with a wizard who worked under cover within the morgue and to get the body replaced with a transfigured transient, and the actual victim transferred into Ministry hands. It was late afternoon when Draco was invited to accompany the investigating officers down to inspect it.</p>
<p>Draco was not fond of morgues, but he’d spent his fair share of time in them when he’d been a working Auror. He entered the cold, sterile place behind the two men, and held back as they examined the decapitated corpse, head neatly aligned but still not attached. </p>
<p>This one was a woman, an attractive one, and they muttered over that, speaking together about what type of person could kill even a female vampire in such a way. Draco thought of his aunt Bellatrix, and thought that they’d simply never encountered the right type of woman. </p>
<p>“Decapitation is infinitely more humane than a stake through the heart,” he said softly, and they turned to glance at him, then went back to their examination without further comment. </p>
<p>When they stepped aside, he drew his wand and approached the body, speaking revealing spells softly under his breath. Immediately, several things began to occur. A faint glow began to shine around the body, deep blue, indicative of death. There were runes within the glow, swirling over the victims wounds and head, each of these a clue as to cause of death. And time. Draco stared at the one that read 12:17 in hieroglyphics, and felt a tremble run through his hand. He muttered another spell, one his American co-horts did not know, and saw the runic symbol for Harry’s name appear briefly over the chalk white forehead before fading almost as quickly as it had come. </p>
<p>“Anything new?” one of the two young officers asked, eyes avid. They were quietly in awe of Draco with his aura reading and his runic scales, and he spared him a quick glance. </p>
<p>“Just more of the same,” he answered. No one this side of the ocean had yet to pick up on the involvement of Harry’s wand in the murders, and he intended to keep it that way if he could. He stepped back, pocketing his wand, rubbing his damp palms on his trousers. </p>
<p>The dream he had the night before had faded in his memory, but the events after he’d awakened had not. He’d seen a man in the park, across from the Inn, at 12:27. A man who even at a distance had resembled Harry so much that it had made Draco’s heart turn over. This woman had been murdered, with Harry’s wand, at 12:17. Something wasn’t right, didn’t add up. Either Harry was dead, and his wand had been taken by someone bent on impersonating him, or…</p>
<p>Draco turned and left the room quickly, and the young officers followed him, exchanging a confused look.</p>
<p>When they were outside of the door, he stopped and turned to them abruptly.</p>
<p>“I need an international floo connection,” he said briskly. “A secure one.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Mr. Malfoy,” the younger of the two said. “I’m sure we can arrange that, if you’ll just follow me?”</p>
<p>He followed them through the catacombs where the morgue was located to the lift.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Something isn’t right, Hermione,” he said from his position in front of the fire. The image of Hermione Granger-Weasley’s head was floating in the green flames, and she was frowning.</p>
<p>“The runes don’t lie,” he went on. “I saw someone in the park across the street at 12:27, not a hundred feet away, and the time of death was 12:17. And it was Harry’s wand, again.”</p>
<p>“Clearly, someone is impersonating him, Draco,” she said pragmatically. “It’s the only answer.”</p>
<p>“Is it?” he asked, running a hand through his hair. “Is it the only answer, Hermione? The people here have no idea what Harry looked like, so there is nothing to be gained from impersonating him. And his body was never found…”</p>
<p>Hermione gave him a stern look. “Draco,” she began, her voice more gentle than her expression.</p>
<p>“Hermione, I saw this man,” he said quickly. “He… resembled Harry. Quite a bit.”</p>
<p>Hermione looked as if she were weighing her words carefully. “And how are your eyes, Draco? I know mine could certainly deceive me at that distance.”</p>
<p>“Hermione, I know what I saw,” he retorted hotly, feeling his temper surge.</p>
<p>“Forgive me, but I think you saw what you wanted to see,” Hermione responded gently. “Think about what you are suggesting. That Harry disappeared, nearly twenty years ago without a word to you, or to us. That he abandoned his children, even though his marriage wasn’t working. That he abandoned you.” She paused, her eyes level. “He’d never have done it, Draco. Not the man we knew.” Draco stared at her, but he knew that what she was saying made sense. He sighed and sat back on his heels. His leg was throbbing, but he’d needed her to say just exactly what she had, needed her cool head and her common sense. He was so weary that his own usually level head felt as if it had been stuffed with cotton, and his rationale seemed to be tottering on the brink of complete collapse. He nodded then with a soft sigh.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” he said softly. “Of course, you’re right.”</p>
<p>She studied him sadly. “I don’t want to be.”</p>
<p>“I know, love,” he breathed. “I do; I know that.”</p>
<p>They’d discussed the cases for a few more minutes, then chatted about her children and things at the Ministry before he signed off. He pushed himself up hanging onto a nearby desk, cursing the fact that most floo conversations had to take place on the floor. It was several minutes before his leg felt steady enough to carry him from the secured office. </p>
<p>By the time he left the Ministry, it was after eight, fully dark, and he was utterly exhausted. The driver stopped in front of the large Inn, stark white in the bright moonlight, and Draco stepped out of the car. He was about to turn and walk up the steps to the leaded glass front doors when something moved in his peripheral vision, and he turned his head in time to see a shadow dart behind one of the large trees in the park. He stared for a long moment, so long his driver, who had opened the door for him, looked at him with a slight frown. </p>
<p>“Sir, is everything all right?” he asked politely.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Draco answered after a short pause. “I just…” he glanced at the man. “I think I’ll take a short stroll in the park, just to work the kinks out.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Malfoy,” the man cautioned quickly. “This is the park…”</p>
<p>“I know,” Draco interrupted him. “Believe me, I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself.”</p>
<p>The younger man studied his face for a long moment, then nodded respectfully and stepped back, closing the car door softly.</p>
<p>Draco set out towards where he had seen something dart behind a tree, and just as he was abreast of the large spreading Magnolia tree, up ahead he saw what was unmistakably a man in a long, dark cape skirt around a fountain and set off down a side path. Draco followed, careful to keep his distance, his eyes on the dark figure as it moved quickly away from the center of the park. Interest fully engaged, Draco picked up his pace as well, moving as quickly as his leg would allow. </p>
<p>When the figure exited the park, moving briskly under a streetlamp, Draco’s breath caught in his throat. It was the man from the night before; he saw the messy hair, the square shoulders. His heart jumping into his throat, he quickened his speed to match the man in front of him, even as the muscles in his thigh began to scream in protest.</p>
<p>He saw him ahead, then gasped when he seemed to disappear into thin air. Quickening until he was running, Draco made it to the place where he’d vanished and realized that there was a narrow alley that ran between two buildings, and he saw the cape disappear around a corner up ahead. Heedless of his own safety, he lunged between the two buildings, his footsteps echoing unevenly in the still darkness and followed, ducking low branches that swept over a wall behind a home, pushing through bushes that encroached through a wrought-iron fence. </p>
<p>When the alley spilled out into the place behind it, Draco paused, his eyes wide. It was as if he’d stepped onto the set of a Hollywood film, and a horror film at that. Up ahead he could see the imposing façade of a gothic style church, stained glass windows lit softly from within, but he was standing in the yard behind the sanctuary; the church’s burial ground. </p>
<p>All around him were headstones and square sarcophagus, chipped and weathered with age, some listing slightly, lying just inches above the ground. There were Celtic crosses and effigies of angels and children, and around one section that was a battered wrought-iron fence, leaning with age. The trees overhead were thick with gnarled, twisted branches and lengths of Spanish moss hung from them, moving slightly even though Draco could detect no breeze. Draco felt a chill skirt over the surface of his skin, and closed his hand over his wand even as he searched the murky shadows. There was a soft sound to his left, and the hair lifted at his nape as he turned in place, and saw that he was not alone.</p>
<p>They came out of the shadows, moving with a stealthy grace that was both beautiful and terrifying. He pulled his wand from his sleeve, but even as he leveled it towards them he knew that there was no way that he could fight off this many alone. There were at least twelve, perhaps fifteen, their faces cloaked in shadows but their movement’s intent, decisive. He braced his feet and continued to hold his wand outstretched even as they seemed to… flow around him, until he was virtually surrounded on all sides. And then they went completely still, and he could feel their eyes.</p>
<p>“I mean you no harm,” he managed finally, grateful that his voice sounded steady, looking from shadowed face to shadowed face. “I was simply following someone I thought…” his voice trailed off when a tall one stepped closer, and Draco caught sight of messy dark hair.</p>
<p>“You thought, what?” a deep voice asked smoothly. “That you knew him? That you’d loved him? Was that it… <i>Draco?</i>”</p>
<p>His name was spoken like a deep caress, and Draco swallowed heavily as the form moved closer. He looked… oh, God, he looked just like Harry, from the messy hair to the square shoulders, to the long, muscular legs. There were Harry’s eyes, Harry’s hands, but the voice… the voice wasn’t right, not at all. It was smoother than Harry’s had been, and there was something… an accent, perhaps.</p>
<p>White teeth flashed in the moonlight, and as he watched a wand was drawn from the sleeve of a dark coat, a spell was muttered, and the figure before him morphed from a vision of Harry Potter to another he recognized, another he hadn’t seen in nearly twenty years.</p>
<p>“Gautlier,” he breathed. The man before him laughed, and it wasn’t a pleasant sound.</p>
<p>“Bravo, young Malfoy,” he said as he moved closer, studying Draco carefully. “Or perhaps, not so young now, eh? Still handsome, but you have not been taking very good care of yourself. You look tired. Sleep disturbed? By nightmares, perhaps?” The superior smile deepened when Draco’s eyes widened. “I have learned many things since last we met, Draco Malfoy. Many, many things.” He twirled the wand in his hand negligently as he began to circle around him, and Draco watched him warily, moving as he moved. “Glamour spells being the least of it.” His smile grew predatory as he continued to move. “And you have been away from the Aurors too long, and have grown careless. What was your first lesson, hmmm? Never to go in alone?”</p>
<p>“What are you doing with Harry’s wand?” Draco asked more forcefully than he would have thought possible, given the circumstances, but Gautlier merely laughed.</p>
<p>“I do not have Harry Potter’s wand, Malfoy.” He shook his dark head almost pityingly. “For someone with such a fine mind, it is taking you an abysmally long time to figure this out.” He continued to circle, Draco continued to follow him. “Think about it, Draco,” he went on in an almost friendly tone. “Why in the world would I be killing my own, my disciples? These are my children, my pets, they do whatever I tell them to do. They are ready to do my bidding, and make me the new Dark Lord.” </p>
<p>The vampires around him cooed and hissed, bared their fangs, and Draco knew then that there was little chance of his getting out of there alive. He was the only one among them with a beating heart, and he knew that they could hear it, could smell his blood. They began to move as well, milling restlessly, not approaching but weaving in and out, making a moving circle around the two of them. Draco’s eyes skirted to them, then back to Gautlier. “Someone has Harry’s wand,” he persisted, pointing his own at Gautlier’s heart. “And you will tell me who it is, or I will kill you.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy, if you persist in this nonsense, you will make me begin to question your intelligence.” Gautlier shook his dark head. “Someone does, indeed, have Harry Potter’s wand.” He smiled beneficently and spread his hands. “Can you not imagine who?” Draco’s eyes darted to the milling creatures around them, then back to Gautlier’s smug face. “Oh, come now. It’s not that hard. The person in possession of Harry Potter’s wand… is the man, himself.”</p>
<p>Draco heard him, heard the words, but it took a moment before they made sense. He tried to dampen dry lips, but his mouth was equally dry and his tongue felt glued to the roof of his mouth. “I don’t…” he shook his head. “That isn’t possible.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it?” Gautlier asked with a smirk. Draco shook his head again, more emphatically.</p>
<p>“He’s dead,” he wheezed. “I saw him die.”</p>
<p>“No,” the Frenchman said almost kindly. “You saw him wounded. You did not see him die.”</p>
<p>Draco blinked quickly, his hands going numb even as he continued to hold his wand pointed at the other man. “I did. I saw him die!”</p>
<p>The handsome vampire shook his head slowly. “Malfoy,” he said on an indulgent sigh, stepping closer. “You did not see Harry Potter die. He did not die from the wounds he sustained during that battle.” Draco lifted the wand until it was pointed at his face and tried to steady his stance, his legs trembling. </p>
<p>“He would never have just disappeared,” Draco argued. “Not if he’d survived. He would have found a way to let us know; he would have come to us.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure of that, are you? You’re so sure of the love he had for you that there are no circumstances you can think of under which he would have chosen to walk away?”</p>
<p>Draco shook his head so emphatically that his fringe fell over his eyebrows. “None.”</p>
<p>“Then you do not know him as well as you thought you did.” </p>
<p>Now it was Draco’s turn to hiss, to bare his teeth. “You’re a liar,” he seethed. “A goddamned liar. He wouldn’t have just left his children…”</p>
<p>“Ah, the kiddies.” Gautlier’s smile turned feral. “So young, so sweet. So vulnerable. So impressionable. Perhaps a father would walk away from his children, in order to save them from the knowledge of what he had become.” </p>
<p>Draco’s mouth fell open then as what Gautlier was trying to tell him suddenly became clear, and the cold in his hands seemed to spread up his arms. “No,” he wheezed. “No, that isn’t possible…”</p>
<p>“Ah, we have arrived there at last,” Gautlier said with a smile as he studied Draco’s shattered expression. “Yes, my friend. It was my brethren and I that attacked you that last night, wizards once, vampire’s now. I told Potter that his arrogance would lead to his destruction, did I not? I told him that he was foolish to believe himself impervious to us. When he allowed himself to be distracted by his pathological need to protect his lover,” he caressed the word almost obscenely, “he left himself vulnerable. He took a particularly strong stunning curse to the chest. He would, no doubt, have recovered from that.” He paused, his lips tipping up in an evil parody of a smile. “He did not survive me.”</p>
<p>Draco felt his eyes begin to sting, and bile hit the back of his throat, forced down with a will. “You… you…” He couldn’t finish the thought, couldn’t bring himself to say it.</p>
<p>“Oh, squeamish, Malfoy?” Gautlier teased viciously. “Perhaps he was right to walk away, if this is your reaction what he has become.” </p>
<p>The vampire moved then, so quickly and so fiercely that one moment he was standing in front of Draco, and the next he was behind him, iron-like arm across Draco’s throat holding him tight against a chest that felt as hard as a granite wall. Draco struggled in his hold, his wand all but useless with Gautlier behind him. He slammed his foot viciously into Draco’s damaged thigh, and when his leg buckled the vampire grabbed his wrist and wrenched it hard. Draco heard the bone snap as white hot pain shot up his arm, and his wand dropped, useless, to the ground. Around them, the dark figures laughed and jeered, a roiling mass of writhing, soulless creatures.</p>
<p>Tears of pain blurred Draco’s vision as Gautlier grabbed a fistful of his hair and jerked his head to the side, and he shuddered helplessly when he felt the vampire’s moist breath against his throat.</p>
<p>“So, I’m to have your pure-blood, am I?” Gautlier crooned, lips brushing Draco’s neck, raising gooseflesh on his arms. He felt Gautlier’s tongue stroke along his jugular, and in spite of himself, Draco felt a surge of heat slither through his body and he shuddered again, but for a totally different reason. He felt the vampire laugh against his skin, and damned his body’s reaction even as he struggled to distance himself from the wave of pure lust that roared through him. “Give up, sweet man,” the dark voice sang against his ear. “For I offer you pleasure unlike anything you have ever known. You will welcome death in my arms, Draco Malfoy. You will beg me for it…” He felt the dark hair brush his cheek as a hard hand came to his chest, unbuttoned his coat, slipped inside to caress his stomach. Draco gasped when the hand slid lower, closing over him, squeezing him gently through his trousers even as he felt sharp incisors scrape against his skin. “Ah, you do like this, don’t you? I knew that you would, all of those years ago. I knew you would be the perfect little whore…” Gautlier paused then, and Draco felt his head lift. “He’s filling in my hand,” he announced into the darkness, and Draco felt swamped by shame that it was the truth. “Are you really willing to just watch, while I take your lover, Potter?”</p>
<p>Even through the haze of arousal, Draco heard what Gautlier had said, and his eyes flew open. He searched the avid faces in front of him, leering obscenely, then searched beyond them, into the gnarled branches of the trees, toward the fences, and the graves. He could see very little in the darkness, but his heart had begun to pound jarringly hard in his chest. </p>
<p>“Ah, he senses you, Potter,” Gautlier called triumphantly. “Just as I do. Can you really just watch while I make him one of us? You disappoint me…” Draco felt the head next to his move as Gautlier searched the burial yard. He tried to catch his breath even as the hand on his cock squeezed hard enough to cause him to whimper in pain. “I know that you are here, damn you!” Gautlier cried out. “I know that you are watching! Fine then, if are willing to sacrifice him, who am I to deny you?”</p>
<p>White-hot pain tore through Draco’s throat as the incisors burst through his skin, but the scream that echoed through the graveyard didn’t emit from his mouth. It was chilling; a sound of rage and pain, and then all was chaos. Once moment, Draco’s throat was being torn open, the next the pain was gone and he was awash in warm liquid that flowed over his neck and his chest, down his arms, over his hands. The arm around his throat went slack and the body behind his fell away, and he collapsed onto his knees clutching his throat, his own hot blood coursing between his fingers. Voices echoed around him, running feet, heavy thuds, curses and cries, and all the while the inhuman screaming went on even as dizziness made his head swim. He pressed his forehead against the mossy earth, and then silence fell so abruptly that he wondered faintly if he’d gone deaf. The last thing he was aware of was another arm, coming gently around his waist, and a voice near his ear, achingly familiar, whispering, “you’re all right, I’ve got you,” just before his world went black.</p>

<p>REMEMBERED FIRE</p>
<p>Part Four </p>
<p>He awoke slowly, swimming up through a heavy fog, the haze enhancing darkness and warmth, softness cocooning his body. He felt heavy, weighed down, and even as his mind registered that he was not, in fact, dead, he couldn’t seem to marshal the wherewithal to care. He drifted for a while, between sleep and wakefulness, luxuriating in the warmth and the lack of pain, not wanting to test the limits of his consciousness enough to search his surroundings. Finally though, almost of their own volition his eyes drifted open, and he found himself in an unfamiliar space, looking up at the heavy black velvet canopy of a massive bed. Light flickered on the dark fabric, and he turned his head and saw that he was in a large bedroom and the only light appeared to be from a fire burning in a fireplace across the room. He stared at it for a moment, watching the flames dance, a frown furrowing his brow. Where was he? He wasn’t in his room at home; the hangings on his huge four poster were white, not black. And he hadn’t been at home, had he?</p>
<p>He lifted his hand to his head, and noticed that his wrist was bruised. He studied the perfect set of finger marks on the white skin, and then it all came back to him in a dizzying rush. He gasped as his hand went to this throat, finding a thick, stiff bandage covering the cool skin.</p>
<p>“He didn’t have time,” a deep voice said, and Draco stiffened. His eyes sought out the owner of the voice, but it had come from a pocket of deep shadow in a far corner and he could not see him. But the sound of it… oh, the sound, even after all of this time, was as familiar to him as his own voice. “I mended the bones in your wrist. The wounds on your throat… those will take longer. I did what I could to close them, but they will probably scar.”</p>
<p>He heard footsteps then, gradually coming closer, and the dancing light of the flames picked up first black shoes, then black denims before revealing a broad chest encased in a fitted black jumper. He paused for a moment, as if realizing that his features were still in shadow, and sank his hands almost nervously into the front pockets of his trousers before taking the final step that would illuminate his face.</p>
<p>Draco knew he’d made a sound, a cross between a gasp and a soft cry, when the green eyes darkened with concern. </p>
<p>“Are you in pain?”</p>
<p>The distance between them was closed in a heartbeat, and Draco lay there staring up into a face he’d thought lost to him forever. </p>
<p>He was pale, but his skin seemed to glow with on odd sort of inner light and the strong cheekbones, square chin and straight nose were just as he’d remembered and yet… so much more. His hair was exactly as it had been when he’d last seen him; short, wild, slightly longer over his forehead in an attempt to hide the scar. His glasses were gone, leaving the deep green eyes unobstructed, the long sweep of thick, silky lashes and the elegantly arched brows uncovered. He looked… unchanged, untouched by age, and so beautiful that it was painful. Draco drank in the sight of him even as his heart lurched and he felt tears fill his eyes. Harry Potter frowned and stepped closer.</p>
<p>“Are you hurting, Draco? I have potions…”</p>
<p>“It is you,” Draco breathed, his heart in his throat. “I thought I’d dreamed it, that it couldn’t be real. My God, Harry, I thought that you were dead.”</p>
<p>Draco saw the sadness that filled Harry’s eyes even as he straightened and took a half step back. “For all practical purposes,” he said somberly, “I am.”</p>
<p>Silence settled between them as they studied each other for a long time, and for his part, Harry seemed as hungry for the sight of Draco as Draco was for him. Draco, however, knew that he had aged, and had suffered by comparison. He lifted his hand to his hair.</p>
<p>“I’m older.” He knew that it was obvious, and immediately felt his cheeks heat. “Well, of course I am…”</p>
<p>“You look wonderful,” Harry said wistfully. </p>
<p>“And you are beautiful,” Draco said, then lifted his hand from the black satin counterpane. “Sit with me?”</p>
<p>Harry looked like he wanted to come and take his hand desperately, but he stayed where he was. “It isn’t a good idea,” he said softly. </p>
<p>“You can’t even sit beside me?” Draco lowered his hand to the satin, his fingers moving restlessly over the bedding. </p>
<p>He shook his dark head regretfully. “It isn’t a good idea, Draco,” he said apologetically. “You have an open wound on your throat, and you must never let yourself forget what I am.”</p>
<p>Draco swallowed heavily. “Can you tell me, at least? Tell me what happened?”</p>
<p>Harry stared into his eyes for a long moment, then pulled one of the hands from his pockets and gestured, and a heavy chair that sat before the fire slid silently across the hardwood floor. Draco’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Your magic has gotten stronger?”</p>
<p>Harry looked at him as he settled into the chair. He shrugged slightly, appearing embarrassed. “Some things. Wandless spells, mostly.”</p>
<p>“And Non-verbal,” Draco murmured. Harry nodded dismissively, as if it really didn’t matter. He settled back into the chair with a soft sigh, his hands moving restlessly on the denim covering his thighs. “What is it that you want to know?”</p>
<p>“Everything,” Draco answered, his eyes glued to Harry’s face. Harry returned that level stare for a long moment, then nodded. </p>
<p>“I suppose I owe you that.” He took and released a deep breath. “Gautlier told the truth out there tonight, at least about part of it. When I saw that hex hit you that night, I… lost my focus. All I could think was that you were hurt, that you had to be taken to safety…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Draco murmured, his throat tight. “I was careless…”</p>
<p>“You weren’t,” Harry countered firmly. “We were set up, and impossibly outnumbered. I knew almost the moment we Apparated in that it was a trap. I didn’t realize that it was Gautlier and his goons.” He shook his head. “Not until later.”</p>
<p>“I saw you go down,” Draco said faintly. “I thought… it looked like…” his voice stalled in his throat then, and his eyes stung as they filled. Harry saw the tears and after pausing just a moment, leaned on the edge of the bed and put his hand over Draco’s. His palm was cool but not cold, and Draco turned his own hand quickly, gripping the offered fingers hard. “Oh, God, Harry…” he choked out as the tears spilled. </p>
<p>“I know, love,” Harry said in a suffocated voice, and Draco saw that his own eyes were bright with unshed tears. “I know, and I’m sorry. So bloody sorry…”</p>
<p>“You didn’t have to go away,” Draco said quickly as the tears spilled down his face. “It wouldn’t have mattered, not to me…”</p>
<p>Harry went very still then, and not unkindly, withdrew his hand. “You don’t know what you’re saying,” he said quietly. </p>
<p>“I do,” Draco countered, rising up onto his elbows. “I wouldn’t have cared. I still don’t care!”</p>
<p>“Draco,” Harry said. “You don’t understand…”</p>
<p>“Then tell me!” Draco knew that his voice had risen, that he sounded desperate. Harry stared, then sighed, his hand coming up to the back of his neck, rubbing at tense muscles there. He finally let his hand fall heavily into his lap. </p>
<p>“I don’t remember the spell that hit me,” he began quietly. “I don’t remember much of anything, for weeks after that night. It’s hard to explain…” He plucked absently at his trousers, his eyes now lowered to his own knees. “Gautlier’s plan from the beginning was to pay me back for being, in his eyes, arrogant. I think he was really insulted that he  couldn’t seem to get to me, that for whatever reason, his ‘charm’,” his lips twisted wryly, “didn’t work on me. He had a rather healthy opinion of himself, and he was highly insulted by my indifference.” His mouth twisted sourly. “Egotistical arse. But more than that, he had concocted this plan to install himself somewhere as a new Dark Lord, and was even then trying to build an army of others just like him.” His eyes lifted then. “Do you remember the attacks that we were tracing, the sudden upswing in supposed Death Eater activity, right before that last night?” Draco nodded faintly. “It was Gautlier and his minions,” he spat. </p>
<p>Draco lay back down, turning his head on the pillow. “It stopped you know, after,” he said softly. “Just… stopped. No more murders, no more dark spells...”</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes, and his broad shoulders lifted and fell with a heavy sigh. “He had what he wanted.” </p>
<p>Silence grew between them for a moment. “He’d wanted you,” Draco finally broke it with a soft gasp. “My God, it was all about getting you.”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t do anything for a moment, then nodded jerkily. Draco rolled to his side, his hand sliding across the satin spread toward where Harry sat. “That doesn’t explain why you just disappeared, Harry.” Harry’s eyes opened on his, then he looked quickly away. “Please,” Draco pleaded softly. “Please. I need to understand.”</p>
<p>Harry swallowed heavily, his Adam’s apple working beneath the pale skin of his throat. “You don’t know what it’s like, Draco,” he said very quietly. “When you’re first… changed, you’re less man than animal. It’s all about feeding. There is no shame, or conscience, or humanity left in you. You are an animal, an animal that needs blood to survive. An animal that needs a handler, a sire, to direct you.” He stopped, his fingers clenching on his thighs, and Draco had to fight the urge to cover one of his pale hands. “In the hands of a decent sire, the transformation can be managed, with a minimum of death. A vampire can feed without killing. But a new vampire is a feral creature, and if left to its own devices, there are no built in regulators to stop it from destroying the very thing that it needs.” He lifted his eyes to Draco’s, and the look in them tore at his heart. “Do you understand?”</p>
<p>He looked so tortured that Draco wished he could say that he did, but Harry could see that he didn’t. He bit his lip, his eyes drifting closed. “Gautlier did not manage me,” he whispered. “He took me places and turned me lose. By the time I’d ‘settled’, I had done… horrible things. Horrible, horrible things.” He shook his head as tears slipped from beneath this closed lids.</p>
<p>“But, you couldn’t help that,” Draco whispered. “You said it yourself; when a vampire is first changed, it has no control…”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes opened, and for a moment they burned. “Muggles, Draco. Women,” he said harshly. “And children.”</p>
<p>Draco couldn’t help it. He recoiled from the words, from the look in his eyes, and Harry saw. He turned his head and closed his eyes, and Draco didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>After a pause, Harry began to speak again. “He did it on purpose,” he went on, his voice deadened. “Allowed me to become a monster, encouraged it, even. When I began to remember who I was, and I knew of the things that I had done…” He paused, his eyes still closed, his jaw tight. “I begged him to kill me,” he whispered into the darkness. “I begged him, on my knees. He laughed.” He shook his dark head, then took a deep breath and opened his eyes. His lashes were damp around them, clumped together and spiky when he looked at Draco once again. “He did try to seduce me,” he went on a bit ironically. “I had enough humanity left in me to be able to resist that, at least. Once he realized that I would never be his mate --” his lip curled at the word, “-- and his need to pull me out into the open had resulted in exactly what he’d wanted, my destruction, he abandoned me to my own devices and left the country. I didn’t know where he’d gone; I didn’t care. I only knew that I couldn’t remain in England, not where there was a possibility that someone might recognize me.”</p>
<p>Draco frowned. “You could have come to me,” he said softly. “I would have helped you.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes warmed for a moment as he studied him. “I know you would have,” he answered pensively. “It’s why I didn’t do it.” Draco knew that the hurt he felt at the words was reflected in his eyes when Harry went on quickly. “Don’t misunderstand,” he said gently. “I wanted to. God, how I wanted to. I watched you, did you know that?” Draco shook his head slightly. “I did. I watched you in the gardens at the Manor, learning to walk again. I saw how… damaged the whole thing had left you, and felt even more ashamed. But I couldn’t come to you, Draco. I couldn’t trust myself. It was all still too new, and I couldn’t trust myself not to take what I know you would have offered. I wasn’t a man anymore, and I couldn’t give you the life that we’d wanted together.” He paused then, his eyes dropping back to his own knees. “I also couldn’t risk someone seeing me. If the media had got hold of it, of what I’d become…” He shook his dark head even as his shoulders stiffened. “I could not leave that as a legacy for my children. It was bad enough that they had to grow up as Harry Potter’s children, but this?” He shook his head more emphatically. “No, I wouldn’t do that to them.”</p>
<p>Draco thought about Scorpius, about how young he’d been when all of this had happened. Harry had three children, and Lily and Albus had been little more than babies. “I understand,” he murmured, and Harry’s eyes came back to his.</p>
<p>“Do you?” </p>
<p>Draco nodded. “I’d not have done it to Scorpius, either.”</p>
<p>Harry studied his face for a long moment before his eyes dropped away. “Thank you for that.”</p>
<p>Silence settled around them, broken only by the soft popping sound of the fire. “How did you end up here?” Draco finally asked. Harry’s green eyes lifted.</p>
<p>“Here, in America? Or here in Charleston?”</p>
<p>“Both. Either.” Draco answered.</p>
<p>Harry leaned his dark head against the high back of the elegant chair. “I wanted out of Europe,” he answered levelly. “I left the vault that my parents had left for Ginny and the kids; it should have been more than sufficient for their needs. But she had never had access to the Black accounts. I cleaned them out as soon as I could. It was a much larger sum than I’d ever realized. I won’t have to worry about money for years.”</p>
<p>“And no one at Gringott’s recognized you?” Draco asked, incredulous.</p>
<p>“Oh, they did,” Harry said, the corner of his lips lifting ironically. “But their code of secrecy extends even to clients that happen to have become undead. You’ve no idea the underground network in most wizard capitals that caters to magical creatures. Even in Britain, there is an entire infrastructure that the wizarding population at large knows nothing about. And here, in America, there isn’t the same prejudice that is still so prevalent at home. Elves are not owned here; they serve but they are paid. And vampires have certain cache that they don’t really enjoy anywhere else.” He smirked slightly, and the expression was so unusual for the Harry that Draco remembered that he could only stare. “We’re considered very sexy,” he said flatly. “And an added benefit; in America, they’ve heard of Harry Potter, but they’ve never seen him.” Harry stared at the floor, his brow slightly furrowed.</p>
<p>“That explains America,” Draco prompted when Harry went silent. Green eyes lifted again.</p>
<p>“I’m in Charleston because Gautlier was in Charleston,” he answered tightly. Draco didn’t prod when he stopped again; just waited. “I was in New Orleans,” Harry said finally. “There’s a large underground there, and the network provides things we need to survive. I began to hear things, about a vampire that was setting himself up with a small army of followers. One who was quite mad, and who was beginning to have delusions of grandeur. Muggle borns were beginning to be targets, unrecognizable spells were being used. I knew it was Gautlier, and I knew what he was trying to do.” He paused, green eyes flat. “I could not let him. He had to be stopped.” Something flickered briefly in his eyes. “He has been stopped.”</p>
<p>Draco inhaled sharply. “He’s dead, then.”</p>
<p>“He was dead before,” Harry responded emotionlessly. “But he’s been ended, yes.”</p>
<p>Draco remembered the wash of liquid that he’d felt spill over him, and glanced down at the white button-down shirt he wore that was not his own. A shudder passed over the surface of his skin, and Harry saw. </p>
<p>“It’s barbaric, but it’s the only way to be completely sure.” </p>
<p>Draco nodded, swallowing heavily. “And his followers?”</p>
<p>Harry shrugged indifferently. “The main ones are gone as well. The rest are little more than parasites who will follow whoever is strongest.”</p>
<p>Draco studied the hard face. “And you are strongest,” he murmured. Harry didn’t respond; he didn’t have to.</p>
<p>“Now you know why I am here,” Harry said, his voice deep. “Why are you?”</p>
<p>Draco studied the steady green eyes. “I had to retire after… my leg.” He gestured towards it, and Harry nodded. “But the Ministry brought me in occasionally to consult, especially when the old Death Eater spells were being recycled.” Harry nodded. “And there was something else.” One black brow arched in question. “Hermione recognized your magical signature on some of the dead vampires. She asked me to come and check it out.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes sharpened at the mention of his friend’s name. “How is she?” he asked quickly. “And Ron? How are they?”</p>
<p>Draco felt a surge of compassion fill his chest. They’d always been so close, the three of them. It would have had to feel like an amputation to lose both of them; Draco knew that was how they had felt. “They are fine,” he assured Harry. “They still have just the two, Rose and Hugo, who have grown into fine people.” He hesitated a moment, then pushed on. “As have your children, by the way.”</p>
<p>Harry looked so stricken that Draco regretted the impetuosity that had prompted him to say it, but then he saw Harry lean forward, his hands on his knees. “Tell me,” he said roughly. “Please.”</p>
<p>“Albus and Scorpius are good friends, actually, and he’s a fine young man,” Draco said kindly. “They were both in Gryffindor, which came as a bit of a nasty shock for my father, I can tell you.” For the first time since they’d been reacquainted, Harry smiled: slowly, a glamorous transformation, dimples appearing where they’d always been. Draco found himself searching his teeth, and Harry must have noticed, because his grin turned slightly wry. </p>
<p>“They descend when I have need for them, and only then,” he answered the unspoken question, and Draco felt himself color in embarrassment at being caught. “And how are James, and Lily?” This was asked anxiously. </p>
<p>“James is a healer,” Draco answered. “He was married about a year ago, and he and his wife have a new baby.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes were shining damply in the firelight. “I’m a grandfather?” he asked a bit breathlessly, and Draco stared into the incongruously young face and nodded slightly. </p>
<p>“You are.” His own voice caught on the next words. “A boy, named Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry blinked quickly, and Draco’s own throat felt thick watching him fight for composure. “And little Lily?” Harry managed after a moment. </p>
<p>“Not so little now. She is a lovely girl, very like her mother in appearance,” Draco answered gently. “She plays chaser for the Harpies.” </p>
<p>Harry shook his head slowly, once again staring at the floor. “She was six months old when I last saw her,” he said wistfully. “How is her mother?” he asked carefully. Draco swallowed an absurd surge of jealousy that he’d even asked; of course, he would ask. She was the mother of his children.</p>
<p>“Fine, at last report. We don’t really see one another,” he answered a bit shortly, and Harry’s eyes lifted to his, knowing. Draco looked away but once again knew his cheeks were flushed. “She remarried. Thomas.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” </p>
<p>Silence settled again. Draco searched his mind for something to say. “Her parents are well, and her brothers.” </p>
<p>“Good. I’m glad.”</p>
<p>Draco plucked at the counterpane as the room quieted. That couldn’t be all there was to be said between them, could it? After all of this time... He searched for something else, considered telling him that Longbottom was now Head Master at Hogwarts, or that Blaise Zabini had beaten his mother’s record and married six times. Or that the remaining Weasley twin was now one of the richest wizards in Britain with the success of his string of joke shops, or that the odd Lovegood woman was now Chief Witch of the Wizengamot. There were so many things he didn’t know, and yet telling him seemed almost cruel, somehow. When Harry’s voice came to him, it was deep, and resonant, almost caressing through the dim light. </p>
<p>“And what about you?”</p>
<p>Draco’s eyes jerked up from where he was staring at the black satin he was fingering, to find Harry’s watching him, gaze penetrating. Draco blinked.</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“How have you been?”</p>
<p>Draco studied the handsome face, considered lying, then couldn’t.</p>
<p>“As dead as I thought that you were.”</p>
<p>Harry looked stunned, then shot up from the chair, his hands going hard into the back pockets of his denims as he turned away. </p>
<p>“That isn’t fair.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t fair?” Draco said incredulously, a surge of anger pulsing through him, and he pushed himself up into a sitting position. “Have you any idea what the last nineteen years have been like for me?”</p>
<p>Harry turned, his own eyes hard. “You mean the last nineteen years, three months, and 18 days? If you give me a moment, I can give you the hours and minutes, if you’d like.”</p>
<p>Draco stared at him. “Harry, you let me believe that you were dead!”</p>
<p>“Draco, I am!”</p>
<p>His words echoed in the shadowy bedchamber as they stared at one another; Draco’s eyes wide, Harry’s face all harsh lines and sharply drawn angles.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Draco whispered, “you aren’t.”</p>
<p>“My God, did you not listen to me at all?” Harry asked sharply. “I’ve done things…” He stopped when Draco reached down and grabbed the cuff at his left wrist, then yanked up his sleeve, revealing the fading Dark Mark.</p>
<p>“Harry, I’ve ‘done things’,” he retorted, shoving his arm forward. </p>
<p>Harry stopped, swallowed heavily. “It isn’t the same…”</p>
<p>“You’re absolutely right,” Draco retorted. “I chose this. You didn’t choose what happened to you.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t change the fact that I’m a monster!” Harry cried, hands fisting. Draco stared at him, and his eyes began to burn.</p>
<p>“You aren’t a monster,” he said, his voice trembling, rising to his knees. He had to make him see; had to make him understand. “You saved me tonight. A monster would never have done that. A monster would have walked away. A monster would not have spent the last six months trying to rid the world of yet another evil. You’re still Harry… my Harry.” He brought his hand up and pressed a fist over his heart. “My Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry turned his back, and Draco saw his broad shoulders trembling. “Don’t do this.”</p>
<p>“Don’t do what?” Draco persisted. “Don’t tell you the truth? Don’t tell you that I’ve loved you every minute of every hour of every day of the last nineteen years? Don’t tell you that now that I’ve seen you again, I can never go back to believing that you’re gone? Because I can’t, Harry. I can’t, and I won’t.”</p>
<p>Harry turned back, his eyes wet, and there were silvery ribbons of moisture on his cheeks, but his jaw was hard. “I’ll Obliviate you, if I have to.”</p>
<p>Draco stared at him, saw that he meant it, but he didn’t believe it. “You won’t,” he said quietly. “You haven’t the capacity to be that cruel. You never have.”</p>
<p>Harry lifted his hands then and rubbed them over his face, then up through his hair in a gesture of frustration that was so achingly familiar that Draco felt his chest begin to throb. “Draco, you must see how hopeless this is,” he said finally, his hands dropping to his sides. </p>
<p>Draco stared at him, then shook his head slowly. “I don’t…” he answered. “I don’t at all.”</p>
<p>“I. Drink. Blood. Human blood.” Harry spaced the words as if speaking to a slow child, his expression exasperated.</p>
<p>Draco merely shrugged, his eyes heating. “I have blood,” he breathed. “And you yourself said that a Vampire needn’t kill to feed…”</p>
<p>He saw Harry’s nostrils flare, saw him dampen his lips with his tongue even as his eyes darkened, and Draco’s cock twitched and began to fill in response. “Stop,” Harry snapped shortly, but Draco saw the reaction his words had had on Harry, and desperation made him press his advantage.</p>
<p>“But I want you,” he said, his voice dropping, his heart pounding with the truth of it. “In all ways, whatever that means now.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know what you’re saying,” Harry muttered, taking a step back. Draco followed an equal distance on his knees. “You’re responding to something you don’t understand, something that’s an inherent part of the vampire. It’s part of our allure, what allows us to seduce our victims. I can’t always control it, and…” he dampened his lips again, and the sheen of sweat began to gather on his forehead. “You don’t want me… you want it.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t insult me,” Draco countered, and Harry stopped moving to stare at him, wide-eyed. “You were able to seduce me long before…” He paused when Harry grimaced. “Long before, when your allure was simply in being you.” Harry’s eyes closed, almost as if he was in pain, and he raised an unsteady hand to his forehead. </p>
<p>“Draco, please,” he said through tight lips. </p>
<p>A sobering prospect occurred to Draco in that moment, something he’d not considered, and he sank onto his heels. “Unless, of course,” he began tentatively, “you simply don’t want me.”</p>
<p>Harry’s hand dropped away, and he stared, brow furrowed. “What?”</p>
<p>Draco lifted his slightly pointed chin, but he could not ignore the possibility. “I’m not so young, anymore,” he said, fighting to keep his voice steady as coldness began to settle inside of him, “or as handsome as I was. I’m… scarred, and I’m losing my hair, and…”</p>
<p>Had he not seen it for himself, he’d never have imagined that someone could move so quickly. One moment, Harry was standing ten feet away. In the next heartbeat, he was standing next to Draco, one hand cupping his jaw, the other gripping his hand. He held Draco’s chin in his hard fingers, his green eyes close and so intense that Draco gasped at the expression in them. “Be quiet,” Harry said, his lips inches away. “You are not the only one who has wanted for every moment of those nineteen years.” He took Draco’s hand and turned it, then pressed his palm over the straining front of his black denim trousers and held it there, canting his hips forward, making Draco forcefully aware of the erection behind the zipper. Draco gasped, his eyes wide on Harry’s as his own cock lurched and filled. “Does that feel as if I don’t want you?” he hissed harshly. “Does it? Wanting you has never been a problem. But to take what you offer, now… I’m not sure I can exist with what that would make me.” He shook his head and started to step away, but Draco tightened his hand on him, causing him to wince and stop in his tracks. Harry’s hand tightened around Draco’s wrist as well, and they were frozen at an impasse.</p>
<p>“If it isn’t that you don’t want me,” Draco said, speaking directly into his face, his eyes moving lovingly over each feature. “If it isn’t about that, then please allow me to make my own decisions. You seem to think I’ve no say in this. You’re wrong.” He saw the green eyes heat as he tried to express his resolve in his own steady gaze. “I am a grown man, Harry. I’ve always known what I wanted.” His eyes settled on Harry’s mouth, which was slightly open as his breathing shortened. “And I’ve always wanted you.”</p>
<p>He leaned up then and without allowing Harry the opportunity to pull away, covered Harry’s lips with his own. He angled his head and slipped his tongue between the parted lips, stroking over Harry’s in a sinuous caress, and he felt Harry shudder briefly before he made a sound, part growl, part moan, in the back of his throat. Then, he was kissing him back.</p>

<p>REMEMBERED FIRE</p>
<p>Part Five</p>
<p>Draco wanted to crow with triumph as a hard arm came around him and lifted him against a muscular chest, and Harry ground their lips together, his tongue swirling skillfully around Draco’s. Immediately, Draco felt a surge of almost animalistic lust roll over his body, and he lifted the hand that wasn’t caressing Harry’s hard cock through his trousers to the back of his head, carding his long fingers through the slightly coarse black hair. </p>
<p>His hair felt the same, exactly the same, and Draco’s heart soared. His tongue tasted the same, and Draco sucked on it greedily. His body felt the same against his, more arousing than any body before or since, and Draco pressed into it, moving his hand from Harry’s cock around to fill his palm with one globe of that hard arse. Harry’s hands lifted to the front of his shirt, and he felt the buttons down the front give. Cool air washed over his skin, making his nipples contract so swiftly and completely that is was almost painful. Snippets of his lost dreams flitted through his mind, increasing his desire, and he reached for the bottom of Harry’s jumper and pulled at it. They separated just long enough for Draco to drag the black wool over his head and throw it aside. </p>
<p>“Oh, my God,” he moaned, running his hands over the muscled wonder that was Harry’s chest, all smooth skin and coarse hair and molded hills and valleys. “Look at you.” His stomach was flat and strong, striated with bands of muscle, the slender trail of black hair that ran from his navel down beneath the waistband of his trousers too tempting to resist. Draco’s fingers went to the short curly hair even as he bent at the waist and swirled his tongue around one copper tinged nipple, and Harry’s hands sank into his hair, holding him in place, a soft groan lifting from his throat. Draco pulled the nipple into his mouth and sucked hard, then teased the resulting pebble with his teeth, and Harry hissed. Draco felt more than heard words muttered beneath his lips, and he gasped as a wave of magic washed over him, removing what was left of his clothing, and Harry’s. He felt his cock hard against his own belly, and he shuddered when Harry’s hand ran the length of his spine. </p>
<p>“Oh, gods,” he groaned against cool skin when Harry’s fingers slid down the crease between his arse cheeks, fingertips ghosting over the tightly furled entrance to his body. Harry’s hands came up beneath Draco’s arms and he lifted him with effortless strength, turning and easing him down onto the bed on his hands and knees. Draco glanced over his shoulder, seeing the intense look on Harry’s drawn face as he studied the round arse before him, then mapped the shape of it with his hands. Magic skirted over Draco’s skin, making him shiver, and he buried his face in the satin spread when he felt Harry’s breath against his balls. </p>
<p>Heat flowed over him in a slow, sensual wave when the hot breath was replaced with a skilled tongue, and Harry licked the swollen ridge behind the soft globes then sucked on first one, then the other, reaching between his slender legs to stroke his cock. Draco clutched the smooth fabric in his hands, his long toes curling when he felt Harry’s tongue travel along the swollen flesh behind them, and skim slickly around the clenched entrance to his body. He knew he was making small, desperate noises, but when he felt that firm tongue pressing forward, seeking entrance, he couldn’t help it. Moments later he was biting down hard on the satin when Harry’s tongue was in his arse, and Draco’s cock was in his hand. </p>
<p>“Oh, gods,” he moaned into the dark duvet. “Oh, sweet Circe.” Harry withdrew his tongue and Draco whimpered, but then gasped when a blunt tipped finger slid smoothly in to replace it. Almost instantly stars exploded behind Draco’s tightly closed eyelids when Harry unerringly caressed the knot of nerve endings that inspired a rare kind of madness. He knew he was mumbling incoherently, but he couldn’t control it. And then Harry’s finger was gone and his tongue was back, and Draco’s breath sawed out hard and he reached back, hand curling around Harry’s nape and then fisting in his thick hair. Harry sealed his mouth over him, thrust into him quickly with his tongue, and Draco thought that his heart might explode. When Harry finally pulled back, pressing a gentle kiss to one shivering arse cheek, then the other, Draco was a quivering mass of jangled nerve endings.</p>
<p>Harry sent his hands up the sides of Draco’s body, then he curled them around his slender ribcage and turned him gently onto his back. As he leaned over him, Draco stared, his eyes glassy and his heart pounding as Harry smoothly parted his thighs and knelt between them. Green eyes fell on the mottled ridge of scar tissue that transected Draco’s thigh, and he traced it with gentle fingers, his eyes dark.</p>
<p>“Does it still hurt?” he asked, his voice slightly rough.</p>
<p>“Not right now,” Draco answered, reaching up to run his hands over Harry’s beautiful chest, and a slight smile pulled at the corner of Harry’s full lips. He caught one and pulled it to his mouth, kissing the knuckles softly.</p>
<p>“Are you ready for me?” he asked, his other hand dropping, sliding between Draco’s legs to give his rock hard cock a slow stroke before dropping lower, two fingers pressing, suddenly slick, then sliding inside his clinging heat. Draco’s neck arched as he pressed his head back into the bed, his own hands curling around Harry’s hard biceps and holding on tight.</p>
<p>“Yes, Merlin, yes,” Draco answered, and Harry leaned forward to kiss him tenderly even as he pressed closer with his hips, lifting Draco’s unscarred thigh around his ribs. Draco felt the smooth head of Harry’s cock against him, and closed his eyes, concentrating on staying relaxed as Harry pressed forward. </p>
<p>It had been a long time. He’d had a few encounters, but a very few, and he’d never let anyone take him; not since Harry had last. Regardless of the preparation, he was tight and it stung. He bit his lower lip hard, trying not to cry out even as Harry moved slowly, gently, trying to allow his body to adjust. He moaned in spite of his resolve as the burning grew, and his teeth pierced his lip. He tasted blood in his mouth. </p>
<p>“Do you want me to stop?” Harry asked gently, his hand spreading on Draco’s rigid stomach. He shook his head quickly but Harry still paused and leaned forward over his body to kiss him. </p>
<p>Draco felt Harry shudder convulsively beneath the hands spread on his back, and Draco’s eyes shot open and he looked up to find Harry’s screwed shut, a grimace on his handsome face. He skin looked white, and was slicked shiny with sweat.</p>
<p>“Harry, what is it? What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes opened, and Draco’s fingers dug convulsively into his arms when he saw that they seemed to be… faintly glowing. “There’s blood,” he answered hoarsely, his eyes avid on Draco’s face. “In your mouth, I tasted your blood.”</p>
<p>Draco caught his breath as Harry’s neck arched and his lips pulled back, and he watched in a combination of terror and arousal as Harry’s white canine teeth began to elongate before his eyes. Harry lowered his head and looked at him again, and the raw hunger Draco saw there sent a shaft of heat through him. Instantly, his tight muscles gave and Harry slid inside of him on a smooth glide, filling him so completely that Draco didn’t know where he ended and Harry began, and his cock throbbed between them. Almost unconsciously, his eyes still held by the glowing green ones above him, Draco’s hand drifted up his chest to his throat, and he began to peel the thick bandages away.</p>
<p>Harry caught his wrist, stilling the motion.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do this,” he said, even as his tongue traveled the length of his plump lower lip. </p>
<p>“I know that,” Draco answered, his voice thin. “I know that. I want to. I want you to.”</p>
<p>Harry released him and he pulled the bandage off and threw it aside, and watched as Harry’s eyes settled on the wounds at his throat, as his pupils dilated until the black nearly eclipsed the green. Harry reached between them and curled his cool hand around Draco’s hardness and began to stroke him even as he lowered himself over him, and Draco felt the moistness of his breath against his throat as he stared up at the black velvet canopy. He couldn’t help it; he stiffened, fingers digging in to hard muscle, and Harry kissed his neck gently before lifting his lips to press them to his ear.</p>
<p>“Relax,” he breathed, his nose nuzzling Draco’s hair. Draco’s hands loosened slightly on his arms. “I’m told it only stings for a moment. And then… then it’s unlike anything you’ve ever felt before.”</p>
<p>Draco tried to regulate his breathing and nodded jerkily, closing his eyes when he felt Harry’s lips slide back down his jugular. He knew that Harry had to be able to feel his heart pounding; he felt those cool lips brush his throat again, then felt the rough silk of Harry’s tongue as he drew it over the wounds that Gautlier had left earlier. Instantly, something ignited low in Draco’s belly, and his mouth fell open as he felt the stiffness in his muscles flow out of his body. </p>
<p>“Oh.“ He sighed. “Oh, yes…”</p>
<p>Harry’s hand moved between them as he began to move in shallow thrusts. Draco gasped again, astonished that he’d actually managed to forget, even for a moment, that he had a hard cock up his arse. But as Harry moved, and it drew over his prostate with each slow drag, pleasure rippled up his spine and fingers curled again into Harry’s arms. He felt Harry’s mouth open further on his throat, felt him sucking against his skin, and he damped his own lips with his tongue. Oh, this… this was… there were no words for how this felt…</p>
<p>He was swimming in an ocean of bliss, waves of sensation crashing over him. Coherency was gone, his sentience minimized almost out of existence. Left in its place was a creature of enflamed needs and raw nerve endings that writhed and sobbed, given more pleasure than one body could hold, in danger of over-dosing on ecstasy. When the sting came, it was so minor that he scarcely noticed it, but when Harry drew against his flesh and drank of him, he felt it intensely. The drawing feeling flowed from his neck, down his chest to his cock which began to weep pre-come, to the dark, needy place that tightened around Harry’s incursion and rippled along his length. He’d never felt anything like it; the almost painful pleasure that went on, and on, rolling in ripples over his skin. The fact that his lover was actually feeding from him, taking sustenance from him was nearly as erotic as the slow love that was being made to him, and his fingers lifted and curled in Harry’s hair as he lingered in a state of near orgasm that was as insidious as it was maddening. It went on and on as he hovered at the knife edge of explosion, and he was weeping in agonized delight when Harry finally drew his tongue over the freshly opened wounds, then turned his head and kissed Draco tenderly, almost chastely on the lips. When he lifted his head, Draco looked up through pleasure glazed eyes to see Harry watching him gently.</p>
<p>“Come, Draco,” he ordered, thrusting into him emphatically, and with a relieved cry, Draco did, his cock throbbing as pearly streams erupted from his body, painting his chest and his abs, dotting his neck and the underside of his chin. Every muscle in his body locked down, bulging with the force of his orgasm as he shook and sobbed. The release seemed to go on and on as Harry pounded into him, and when he felt the shudder that shook Harry’s body and the warm wash of his spill filling him, his cock pulsed and jerked and shot between them once again before Draco sagged limply and slipped into darkness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Draco woke again, it was much as it had been before. He lay in the center of the big, soft bed, encompassed in warmth, but with the new limp lassitude that comes from having a soul draining orgasm. He sighed in satisfaction, then opened his eyes, searching for Harry. When he found the bed beside him empty, he frowned and pushed himself up on his elbows, searching.</p>
<p>Across the large room the black velvet drapes had been pulled aside, and a set of French doors had been opened. Moonlight poured into the room, shining on the hardwood floor, revealing a wide balcony outside of the doors. Standing at an ornate railing with his broad back to the doors, naked in the glow of the full moon, Harry looked like something carved of marble, all strong lines and solid muscle. His hair was the only thing about him that wasn’t streamlined and elegant, and it stood up in messy black spikes around his head, causing Draco’s heart to lurch with tenderness. He slipped out of the bed, wincing a bit as muscles long unused reminded him that he wasn’t twenty-nine, but he ignored them and padded barefoot and as naked as Harry across the room. </p>
<p>He slipped out through the doors and up behind him, sliding his arms around Harry’s waist and resting his chin on his solid shoulder. Harry didn’t respond with surprise, just curved his hands over Draco’s and gripped them, then leaned back into him with a soft sigh.</p>
<p>They stared out at the view, and Draco murmured softly in appreciation. They were standing on a second floor balcony of what looked to be a very large country house, staring over a large sloping lawn towards a slowly moving river. There was a full moon, and the water glittered with its light, and there was a line of old growth trees along the bank, their branches swathed in Spanish moss.</p>
<p>“How beautiful,” Draco said softly, watching the moss shift in the slight breeze. It was a little cool, and he pressed himself against Harry’s back. “Where are we?”</p>
<p>“It’s called Ashton Hall,” Harry answered, and his voice vibrated through his back and against Draco’s chest. “About fifteen miles outside of Charleston. It was built in the late seventeen hundreds, and it’s never been wired for electricity or fitted for plumbing.” He shrugged. “Which really doesn’t matter much to a wizard. It’s on the national registry of historical sights, and they used to do tours.” Draco heard the smile in his voice. “That is until it got the unfortunate reputation for being extremely haunted.”</p>
<p>Now Draco smiled. “Your doing?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Harry shrugged. “I like it. It has an old world charm. I put a glamour on it, and most folks stay away.”</p>
<p>“Most folks?”</p>
<p>“Oh, we get the occasional intrepid ‘ghost hunter’. We give them a nice show, and they go away happy.”</p>
<p>“We?” Draco asked a bit more sharply than he’d meant to, and Harry chuckled, turning, taking him in his arms. </p>
<p>“Jealous?” he asked, one black brow arching. </p>
<p>“Extraordinarily,” Draco answered, pressing in to kiss him softly, then leaning back to study him once again. “Don’t you live alone?”</p>
<p>Harry smiled slowly. “Actually, I have a man-servant.”</p>
<p>It was Draco’s turn to arch a brow. “Oh, really.”</p>
<p>“His name is Michael,” Harry said imperturbably. “He’s a muggle-born, very charming, has infinitely better taste in clothing than I do,” he paused, grinning when Draco’s mouth turned down at the corners, “and I believe he turned eighty-two on his last birthday.” </p>
<p>“Oh,” Draco said, mollified. “Well, unless he’s a startlingly handsome eighty-two, I guess that’s all right.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled and kissed him again, this time lingering over it a bit. When he pulled back, he reached up and pushed Draco’s long fringe back from his eyes. “Michael takes care of me, Draco. That’s all. I saved his granddaughter from Gaultier nearly five years ago, and he feels he owes me. And during the day, when I sleep, I’m… somewhat vulnerable. He’s a fair cook, and decent company, and I’m grateful that he’s willing to put up with my unavoidable eccentricities. He’s very kind, but he’s just my friend.”</p>
<p>“Harry, I was teasing,” he assured him, but secretly he was glad that the man was someone’s grandfather. </p>
<p>“No you weren’t,” Harry countered, green eyes soft. “But I like that you’re territorial. I want you to feel that way, because I don’t believe I’ve ever had that sense of belonging to anyone quite like I did with you.” </p>
<p>Draco reached up then and cupped the hard cheek in one hand, index finger drifting across the sharp angle of a chiseled cheek bone. “I love you,” he said simply and Harry studied his face carefully before turning his lips into Draco’s palm.</p>
<p>“I know that you do,” he murmured against the pale skin, then kissed it lingeringly. “I love you, too.” Draco’s fingers curled reflexively and he felt a stirring at his groin when Harry’s tongue leisurely traced his lifeline. He felt a responding twitch in the cock that was pressed against his thigh. “But,” Harry lifted his eyes back to Draco’s, “we need to talk.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Draco answered, reaching between then to curl his hand around the rapidly filling erection, stroking it slowly as he leaned forward and kissed Harry’s neck. Harry allowed his head to drop back on a soft sigh as Draco mapped his throat with his mouth, his tongue, his teeth. “We do not, however,” he whispered against Harry’s ear, his tongue tracing the cool shell, “need to talk right now.”</p>
<p>“Soon,” Harry said, even as he swallowed heavily. </p>
<p>“Yes, soon,” Draco agreed, knowing that it was true. “But right now--” the strokes on the cock now filling his hand grew firmer, “--I want you again.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” he heard the smile in Harry’s voice, and turned his head to kiss it from his lips. This kiss was long and slow, leisurely, open mouthed, tongues tangling lazily, Draco tracing the now even front teeth with the tip of his. To know that the incisors would only descend when Harry had need of them was both reassuring, and incredibly sexy. When their lips parted, Harry sent Draco an enigmatic look, then with that startling strength that made Draco breathless, bent and simply swung him up in his arms, carrying him back to the wide bed. </p>
<p>“Well,” Draco gasped as Harry settled him against the sheets and then leaned over him. “I haven’t been swept off of my feet in a very long time.”</p>
<p>Harry grinned down at him, eyes alight with love and humor. “Get used to it.”</p>
<p>Draco’s hand slipped around his neck and his fingertips teased the curls at Harry’s nape. “I can do that.”</p>
<p>They exchanged a playful look before Harry’s lips were descending to his neck once again. He slid his nose along Draco’s jugular, then his tongue under his chin. </p>
<p>And as he stared up into the underside of the black canopy and the slow, sweet fire began to build once again in his blood, Draco knew that there was still much to be discussed, but he’d already made up his mind. He loved his mother, and he adored his son, but the man in his arms was the other half to his soul, and he’d never voluntarily give that up again. His family need never know the whole truth, only that he’d found someone that he could love. Those details could be worked out later. But to have the chance to have this, this tender inferno, for eternity? What man could resist such temptation?</p>
<p>He knew that Harry would fight him on it, wouldn’t believe that he really meant it, but Draco knew that with loving persuasion he could convince him. And he had every intention of doing just that.</p>

<p>Remembered Fire... Epilogue</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scorpius Malfoy sat at the desk that had once been his father's, going over the financial pages of the <i>Daily Prophet</i>, studying which of their stocks was performing, and which was lagging behind.  It had been a long week, and he was still in his shirt sleeves, his tie loosened yet still hanging around his throat, his jacket abandoned over a nearby chair.  The fire in the hearth crackled merrily, adding a golden warmth to the room, but to Scorpius, the room had always been warm, always been a place of welcome.  He'd played beneath this desk around his father's legs when he'd been a child, he'd taken his first lessons, long before Hogwarts, lying before the fire while his father had worked into the night. He sighed and closed the paper, folding it neatly, his eyes catching on a framed picture at the corner of the massive desk, and he reached for it, studying the images with a soft expression.</p>
<p>His father looked pale in the photograph, he thought as he studied the drawn face, and tired.  It had been taken when Scorpius was four, and he knew now the personal tragedy that had etched the exhaustion into the aristocratic features.  But as he watched the wizard photo, and the figures moved, he was reminded yet again why he kept the photo on his desk.  For all of his personal pain, the hands that Draco Malfoy used to touch his toddlers pale blond head were gentleness itself, and the kiss he pressed to his temple, eyes closed, displayed the love he held for his son more than words ever could.  Scorpius watched his father kiss him once, then again, and sighed softly.</p>
<p>He missed his father, desperately sometimes. And often, he blamed himself for Draco's absence.</p>
<p>Forty-three years before, at his son's urging, Draco Malfoy had gone to America to help their Ministry with a case.  It had seemed very important at the time, and Scorpius had thought if his father could just put some of his painful memories to rest, he might find a measure of personal contentment, if not happiness.  His father had been an Auror once, before an injury had forced his retirement, and his skills had been invaluable in cracking the case of a maddened Vampire that had been trying to set himself up as a new Dark Lord. When evidence that someone had found and was using the legendary 'Harry Potter's' wand had come to light, Scorpius had known that his father needed to go, needed to be there, needed to be part of the solution. Needed to put his own ghosts to rest.</p>
<p>Scorpius had never judged his father.  When his mother had told him that his father had been unfaithful to her, it had hurt him, but not for the reasons she'd thought.  Scorpius did not care that his father had had an affair with a man.  He didn't even care that the lover in question had been the great war hero, himself.  In the ways of most children, he'd only cared that it had disrupted his sense of permanence, and security.  But Draco had proved to him every day right up until he'd gotten on that plane to America, and even after,  that regardless of who he shared a bed with, it was Scorpius that he treasured, Scorpius that he loved. </p>
<p>Scorpius had been surprised, but pleased when his father had called him, telling him that he'd 'met someone', and that he wanted to see where it went.  The Manor had offered little comfort to Draco once his wife found out about his affair.  Scorpius loved his mother, but he wasn't blind to her faults. He knew she was a miserable shrew, so he couldn't begrudge his father a chance at happiness when he'd found it.  He'd just never expected him to stay away permanently.</p>
<p>In a stunning move, Draco had signed the reins of the Malfoy Conglomerate over to Scorpius four years after moving to America.  He was fairly mysterious about his new lover; he told Scorpius that he was an Englishman, and a wizard, but little else.  He stayed available to offer advice and counseling, but he withdrew from the business completely, stating that he was 'starting over', and that he trusted Scorpius to take care of his grandmother and the family's affairs.  There was a post office box in South Carolina where he sent correspondence, and for several years he'd spoken to his father via mobile, but then, suddenly, Draco simply disappeared.</p>
<p>Scorpius had hired private investigators.  He'd even gone to America himself to search for his father, but he'd simply vanished into thin air.  Defeated and grieving, he allowed himself to believe that his father had met a bad end at the hands of his lover, and he blamed himself.</p>
<p>But then, something unusual had happened.</p>
<p>His grandmother, who missed her son dreadfully and had become frail in her old age, had received a letter.  He'd been seated with her at the breakfast table when the post had come, and he'd seen the color leach from her face when a house-elf had delivered her a missive on a silver tray.</p>
<p>“Grandmother,” he'd asked solicitously.  “Are you all right?”</p>
<p>She'd met his eyes and nodded regally, then left the room, but she'd looked so stricken that he'd followed her shortly after.</p>
<p>He'd never forget for as long as he lived what he saw upon finding her.  She's been seated in a Queen Anne chair before her fire, silent tears slipping down her cheeks even as she smiled.  He crossed to her quickly and knelt at her feet, his hand reaching out to touch her wrist. </p>
<p>“Grandmother, are you ill?” </p>
<p>She found his eyes, hers bright with tears.  “Oh, no, my darling,” she whispered.  “I am better than I have been in... so long.” She took a shuddering breath and released it slowly.  </p>
<p>“What is it, then?” he asked, gently stroking her pulse point.  </p>
<p>Her eyes warmed on his face.  “I've had a note from your father.”</p>
<p>Scorpius had caught his breath raggedly.  At that point, his father had been gone and presumed dead for nearly fifteen years.  He stared at the stiff white parchment she still held in her other hand. </p>
<p>“May I?” he asked softly, and she'd handed him the letter eagerly.</p>
<p>Across the expensive foolscap, in a hand that he recognized instantly, were the words:</p>
<p>
  <i>“Those who love do not die; perhaps they become translated from this perishable world to the world of eternal existences.”  The Prophet Muhammad </i>
</p>
<p>And beneath that was written;</p>

  <i> Rest easy, my darling. Do not grieve for me, for I am with you, and will love you always. </i>
</p>
<p>There was no signature, but there didn't need to be one.  </p>
<p>When Narcissa had died not long after, Scorpius had buried the note with her. </p>
<p>For as happy as he'd been about the measure of peace the note had given his grandmother, Scorpius had been both hurt and angered by it.  It had been years, <i>years</i> since there had been any word from his father; they'd all believed him dead, and when he finally had gotten in touch, it had been two or three scribbled lines to his mother about 'eternal love' or some rot, and nothing else.  Scorpius hadn't wanted to feel slighted by it; Narcissa hadn't been well and that little note had scarcely left her hand in her final days, but he felt as if his father had slapped him.  Was he not important enough to his father for him to contact <i>him</i>, too?  And where was he?  Clearly, he'd discovered some consuming passion in whoever this mystery lover was.  So consuming that it had made him forget himself, his responsibilities, his family... Scorpius hadn't wanted to be hurt by it, but he had been.  So hurt that for the next decade he'd tried to convince himself that he didn't care if his father was alive or dead.</p>
<p>But now, in his mid-sixties, a measure of understanding had come to Scorpius.  </p>
<p>When he'd married his wife, Araminth, he'd done what he thought that he had to do and married a pure-blood witch of good family.  His mother had been pleased, and Scorpius had liked the girl well enough.  She was easy-going, of sunny disposition, and wasn't too demanding.  He'd been in his late thirties, she'd been in her mid-twenties, but for the differences in their ages, he'd grown to care about her, very much.  She'd given him four children, three boys and a girl, and it was the birth of that precious little girl, his Narcissa Marie, that had made him begin to question his icy anger at his father.  </p>
<p>Draco had loved him; Scorpius knew that as surely as he knew the sun would rise in the morning.  He'd doted on him, built his life around him.  Scorpius knew that his parents were not happy together, and that the center of Draco's existence for most of his life after Potter was killed was Scorpius himself.  So, what kind of love would it have taken for Draco to leave his obligations, his family, his <i>son</i> behind?  Clearly, something earth moving; something profound.  Something completely different and yet as deep as what he felt for his Narcissa Marie, and his anger at his father began to slowly fade until it was little more than a memory. He could honestly say, at sixty-five, that he wished his father well.  He'd be in his early nineties now, but if he was still alive, he hoped that he was happy with the life that he had chosen.</p>
<p>Setting the photo back on the corner of his desk, Scorpius rose stiffly from his chair, pausing to stretch his back before crossing the room to one of two wing backed chairs that sat before the fire.  There was a snifter of brandy already placed on a small table.  He picked it up and held it in his hand, taking a slow sip, enjoying the way it burned down into his stomach, before settling into the padded chair.  Araminth was from the Manor that evening at some sort of witch's gathering for the solstice, and the children had long been away from home, leaving him alone in the vast house.  He kicked his shoes off and stretched his feet out towards the fire, and sighed deeply, taking another sip of the strong liquor.  Gods, he was tired...</p>
<p>He wasn't aware of falling asleep, and he wasn't sure he'd actually wakened when his eyes drifted open and he found himself studying the heavy velvet curtains across the room.  They were a deep, hunter green, a hold over from his grandfather Lucius's time, and frankly Scorpius had never liked them much.  Just now, they seemed darker near the center, somehow.  Almost black, as if there was a shadow just there, near the middle.  Scorpius blinked when the shadow separated itself from the heavy draperies and took a step toward the light.</p>
<p>He knew that he should be alarmed, and yet the misty, almost dream-like quality of what he was feeling made him more curious than afraid.  The figure moved closer, almost as if it were gliding, and then stopped not more then five feet away from  him, still in slight shadow, but clearly a tall, slender man in a hooded cloak, face lost in shadow.  Still surprisingly detached and calm, Scorpius watched as pale, long-fingered hands lifted, and carefully folded the cloak back from the faintly pointed face.</p>
<p>“Father?” he gasped, straightening.  Even as he said it, he realized that this must, in fact, be a dream, for the face he stared into looked no different than his father had looked when he'd left him that night all of those years ago at Heathrow. No, he amended, drinking in the sight of Draco Malfoy smiling at him gently.  He'd never seen his father look like this; not in person.  In photos, maybe, but even then...</p>
<p>His receding hairline was restored, his hair a gleaming swatch of white blond over his forehead.  His face was unlined and his eyes were clear, and Scorpius knew that he had never looked as well in life as he did in this dream image.  Convinced now that he was asleep, and yet so happy to see Draco, Scorpius blinked back tears.  </p>
<p>“Hello, son,” Draco said smoothly, taking another step into the light.  </p>
<p>“Gods,” Scorpius managed, sounding suffocated.  “You look... you're.... you're so young!”</p>
<p>Draco laughed, reinforcing Scorpius's conviction that he was dreaming.  Draco had never sounded so relaxed, or so free.  His grey eyes mellowed as he studied his son.</p>
<p>“And you, fortunately, seem to have managed to avoid the Malfoy hairline.”  He studied Scorpius as if starved for the sight of him.  “You are a distinguished man, my son.  With your hair in tact.”</p>
<p>Scorpius continued to stare even as his father gracefully settled into the chair opposite him, crossing his long legs.  Astounded by the vividness of the dream, he studied the dark wool slacks, and the slender, heeled leather boots.  There even seemed to be snow melting on the shiny black shoes, and Scorpius marveled at the power of the subconscious.  He watched his father arrange his cloak over his lap, saw the firelight gleaming in the platinum signet ring he still wore on his right hand.  The Malfoy signet ring; he'd never seen his father's hand without it.  </p>
<p>“I'm sure you've questions,” Draco said when he was settled.  “I cannot answer many of them. I simply hope that you are not... too angry with me.”  He studied Scorpius's face almost anxiously. </p>
<p>“I was,” Scorpius admitted.  “For a very long time, I was.  But now...”</p>
<p>“Time heals,” Draco provided softly, voice mellowing.  </p>
<p>“And offers perspective,” Scorpius added.  “I've children; did you know?”</p>
<p>Draco smiled slightly.  “I was honored that you named the eldest after me,” he said.  “And the girl after my mother.”</p>
<p>It was Scorpius's turn to smile.  “She is the light of my life.”</p>
<p>“As you were mine,” Draco murmured, still studying Scorpius's face.  “And still are.  I hope you've never doubted it.”</p>
<p>“I confess to having had... doubts.”  Draco eyes darkened.  “But then, Narcissa Marie was born, and... I realized something.”</p>
<p>“And what was that?” Draco prompted gently.</p>
<p>“I'd never loved anyone like that before,” Scorpius admitted faintly.  “I didn't know myself capable.  And I realized then that what I was feeling; you'd felt that for me.”  Draco nodded, his eyes suddenly suspiciously bright.  “And that, whoever this love was that you'd found, he must be very special, or you'd have never...”  Scorpius's voice trailed off.</p>
<p>“He was,” Draco said fervently.  “He is. I'd have never left you, or my mother, if he wasn't.”  He paused.  “And I'd never have left you if I hadn't felt that you were ready for me to.”</p>
<p>Scorpius frowned slightly.  “I don't think I was...” He began, but Draco shook his head.</p>
<p>“Son, you were,” he said emphatically.  “At twenty-two, you were more a man than I was at thirty-five.  More sure of your place in the world, more in command of the business.  More in command of your life.”  He paused, still smiling faintly.  “You were ready, Scorpius, or I'd not have gone.”</p>
<p>Scorpius stared into his father's light eyes, into the startlingly young face.  “This is a dream, isn't it?” he asked abruptly.  Draco's cocked his head to one side.</p>
<p>“Is it?”</p>
<p>“It's the only explanation for you looking thirty years younger than I am.” </p>
<p>Draco's smile widened.  “It's not the only explanation, but it's certainly the most rational one.”</p>
<p>“I was thinking of you, earlier,” Scorpius went on.  “Looking at the photo that you kept on the desk...”</p>
<p>Draco glanced over his shoulder at the silver frame, and when he turned back his eyes were wistful.  “Yes.  I loved that photo.  I still do.”  His eyes moved over Scorpius's features carefully.  “And I love you, son.  With all of my heart.”</p>
<p>Scorpius felt his eyes began to tear, and he blinked quickly.  “I've missed you, sir.”</p>
<p>Draco studied him as if memorizing his features.  “And I, you.  And I suppose I should feel guilty, for leaving you, for taking the chance at happiness when it was presented to me.” He paused.  “But I hope you will understand when I say that I don't.  I can't.  I was so desperately lost, Scorpius, so miserable.  For so long...”</p>
<p>“I know,” Scorpius said quickly, then paused.  “You're still with him, then?”</p>
<p>The smile that broke over Draco's face was brilliant, and Scorpius could only stare.  Even he could see the beauty in his face.  “And will be,” he said firmly.  “Until the end of time.”</p>
<p>“As long as that?” Scorpius teased, but Draco looked as if he knew the answers to questions unasked when he inclined his head regally.</p>
<p>“As long as that.  And now, I must go.” He stood then, a fluid, almost supernaturally beautiful motion, and Scorpius began to stand as well.  “No,” Draco said softly, putting out his hand, gesturing him down.  “Be still, Scorpius.  There's no need for you to rise.”</p>
<p>“I wish to embrace you, sir,” Scorpius said, alarmed when around the edges of his vision, a greying mist appeared.  He blinked even as Draco smiled regretfully.</p>
<p>“One cannot embrace a dream, son,” he murmured.  Scorpius wanted to ignore him, wanted to stand, but suddenly, his head began to loll and he felt the vision slipping away.  </p>
<p>“I... will I ever see you again?” He managed, sounding groggy even to himself.  </p>
<p>“Anything is possible,” Draco murmured, and his voice sounded distant to Scorpius's ears.  “Just remember; I love you, Scorpius.  I always shall.  And I am so proud of the man you have become...”</p>
<p>“I... love you... too, sir...”  his voice faded as the image before him drifted away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>oooOOOooo</p>
<p>He was waiting, standing by the ornate gates, broad shoulders swathed in black velvet, tousled black hair blue in the moonlight.  Draco approached him soundlessly, but he knew that he was coming, and turned, opening his arms.  Draco went gladly into his embrace, pressing his forehead to the sturdy jaw.</p>
<p>“How is he?”  The deep voice was resonant in the darkness.</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” Draco answered a bit wistfully.  “A fine figure of a man.”</p>
<p>“Of course he is,” came the answer.  “Look at his father.”</p>
<p>Draco leaned back and looked into the face that he'd proved he loved more than life itself; into the green eyes, almost black in the moonlight, that studied his face so carefully.  “I'd rather look at you.”</p>
<p>A dimple appeared just to the left of the mobile mouth, and Draco touched it gently with his fingertips.</p>
<p>“Are you glad you went to see him?” Harry asked gently, his hand spreading on Draco's back, pulling him closer.  Draco swallowed heavily, but nodded.</p>
<p>“I needed to,” he answered.  “I used a spell.  He'll never be sure it wasn't a dream.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded slightly.  “That's probably wise.”  Draco shrugged slightly, but Harry knew that in his heart, he agreed.</p>
<p>“Are you quite certain that you don't want to...”</p>
<p>“No,” Harry said softly, cutting him off.  Draco searched his eyes.  “It's better this way, love.  Their lives are set, they've moved on.  It could only cause them pain.”</p>
<p>Draco wasn't sure that he agreed, but he differed to his judgment.  “Are you ready, then?” he asked, and Harry nodded.  </p>
<p>“I've never seen Paris,” he admitted softly.  Draco's smile began to grow.  </p>
<p>“Then I shall take enormous pleasure in showing it to you.” </p>
<p>Harry pulled him in even more snugly against his body, his hand drifting down to Draco's arse and curving over it through his heavy clothing.  “I take enormous pleasure in everything you show me.”</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes  slightly and batted at his arm, but his smile widened.  “Honestly, Potter,” he scolded lightly.  “You're 91 years-old.  Act your age.”</p>
<p>“Never,” Harry grinned, his young face glowing.  “So, Malfoy.  Paris?”</p>
<p>Draco nodded, his eyes alight.  “Paris.”</p>
<p>Harry bent his head and captured Draco's lips in a kiss that was no less heartfelt for it's brevity, then tucked the fair head into his neck and stepped into a turn.  They disappeared into the mist with a soft 'pop'.</p>
<p>oooOOOooo</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scorpius jerked awake with a slight snort, not sure what had disturbed him, to find himself still sitting in the wing-backed chair before the dying fire.  He had no idea how late it was, only that it felt as if he'd been sleeping for hours.  His hand lifted to slide over his white hair when snippets of his extraordinary dream began to drift back to him.</p>
<p>He'd had a conversation with his father.  He paused, staring into the fire.  An amazing conversation.  And his father had looked... marvelous.  Happy.  Young. And he'd told Scorpius what he'd needed to hear; that he loved him.  Missed him.  Was proud of him.  The thought brought a wistful smile to his lined face.</p>
<p>Scorpius shook his head in bemusement, sitting forward in his chair.  “Time for bed, old man,” he muttered to himself.  “You're getting fanciful in your old age.”  He propped his hands on the arms of the chair and was prepared to stand when his eyes caught on something lying on the small table next to his brandy snifter, and he went very still, staring.</p>
<p>It was ring.  </p>
<p>Not just any ring, but a platinum ring, and curled into a small scroll and slipped through the center was what appeared to be a photograph.</p>
<p>Scorpius felt his heart slam against his ribs.  He knew that ring; would have known it anywhere, with its entwined serpents over a standard of blooming lilies etched in the gleaming face.  It was the Malfoy signet ring, the one that had never left his father's hand.  How...?</p>
<p>Hand trembling, Scorpius reached out for it, almost afraid to touch, certain that the platinum would feel like ice in his hand.  It didn't.  Warmed by the fire, it seemed to almost throb with a heartbeat of its own.  Scorpius stared at the family crest for a long time, then slid the rolled photo from the ring before slipping it onto the third finger of his right hand.  It fit him perfectly.</p>
<p>Blinking away suspicious moisture from his eyes, he slowly unrolled the photograph and stared at it, his eyes widening, his hand lifting to press over his heart as he stared.</p>
<p>It was of two young men; one dark, one fair, smiling into the camera, their arms around one another.  As he watched, the dark-haired man with the wire rimmed glasses and the messy hair and famous lightning bolt scar leaned in and caught the fair man's lips in a quick kiss, and the blond laughed and returned it before turning his head and grinning.  They looked so young, so happy.  So... <i>free</i>. </p>
<p>Scorpius watched the scene play out again, and again, a slow smile beginning to pull across his own lips.</p>
