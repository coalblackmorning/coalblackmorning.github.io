<p class=MsoNormal>Draco Malfoy sighed as he
looked at the clear glass door in front of him with the name of some crackpot
doctor inscribed on it.  He could see a
waiting room beyond with posh, comfy chairs and a variety of magazines to
please any palate.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>But no matter how lush the waiting
room was, it was still a waiting room, and it was still a waiting room for a
psychiatrist at that.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco gritted his teeth.  For the record, it was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not </i>his idea to be here in the first place.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>'''''</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Three days earlier</i>…</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So then Potter - stupid git
that he is - sees the snitch and does a full back-flip on his broom before
heading down to get it.  I mean,
honestly, does that prat have to show off every chance he gets?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Because there's no possible way
that Potter was just getting to the snitch as fast as possible?" Lucius Malfoy
muttered under his breath.  He fingered
his orange juice and sighed.  Narcissa
patted his hand sympathetically.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Draco darling, why don't we
talk about something other than Harry Potter?" she said sweetly.  "Have you met any nice young men lately?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco shrugged.  "Not really," he said, helping himself to a
croissant.  "I had lunch with Daniel
Darcy on Wednesday.  I thought was an
alright bloke, but it turns out he's a huge Chudley Cannons fan and actually
has Potter's autograph.  Really, who the
hell would want that self-righteous half-blood's autograph?  And of course Daniel had to tell me all about
how he got it, and what a swell bloke that Potter chap is and how fit he is and
all that.  I mean, here I was trying to
eat my lunch and Daniel just wouldn't <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shut
up </i>about Potter."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mmm, imagine that," Narcissa
said, a small smile playing on here lips. 
Lucius made a growling sort of noise. 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Beanie!" he called out.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>With a small pop a House Elf
appeared.  "Yessir?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Can't you bring me something
with alcohol in it?" he snapped.  Beanie
nodded once and disappeared.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Honestly," Lucius muttered
under his breath.  He cleared his
throat.  "Draco, I am trying to enjoy a
nice Sunday brunch with you and your mother. 
I am not interested in talking about Harry Potter.  It has been two years since the two of you
graduated from Hogwarts.  I realize he
was rather the focal point of your existence there for seven years, but
honestly, aren't you past all this?  It's
beginning to sound like you're obsessed."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Obsessed?" Draco
scoffed.  "Me?  Please, Dad. 
I'm only absolutely mad for him."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"What?" Lucius and Narcissa asked
in one voice.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>said</i>, I'm really very sad for him. 
He must be ridiculously insecure to have to show off all the time."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Lucius and Narcissa exchanged
a glance.  With another small pop, the
House Elf returned, handing Lucius a glass of something clear and bubbly.  He took it and sipped.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Tell us more about Daniel,"
Lucius said, changing the subject.  "He's
a nice boy from a good family.  I'd like
to see you settle down."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"He is lovely.  He's got awfully nice hair, jet black and
thick," Draco mused.  "But he's not
really my type.  He's too uptight.  Always follows the rules, never takes
risks.  And he doesn't even play
Quidditch."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Whatever happened to
Geoffrey?" Narcissa asked.  "He was a
Quidditch player, and I thought you liked him." 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Reserve</i> Quidditch player, and a Beater at that," Draco
sniffed.  "You know I prefer
Seekers.  He had nice eyes, very bright
green, but his red hair reminded me too much of a Weasley."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hugh?" Lucius asked, swirling
his drink in his glass.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hugh was a doormat.  He let me walk all over him.  I like my men to have a backbone."  Draco helped himself to a pastry.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Marcus?" Narcissa quiered. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco shrugged.  "I liked his glasses.  Made him look smart.  But he was actually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>too</i> pure-blooded, if you can imagine.  Talked about nothing else.  It got old."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Amir? Jude? Tyrone?"  Lucius asked. 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Basil? Wang? Patrick?" Narcissa
added.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Amir was too tall, Jude too
short and Tyrone too beefy," Draco said, checking off each point on his
fingers.  "Basil only wore wizard robes
and I've got fond of muggle clothes, Wang was too involved in his studies and
Patrick was sort of evil.  I like
boyfriends who are all righteous and good, so that I can be the evil one."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let me get this straight,"
Lucius drawled.  He paused.  "So to speak."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Very funny, Dad," Draco said
sourly.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You are looking for a man
who is tall but not too tall, not beefy, who plays Quidditch, wears muggle
clothes and takes risks.  You want
someone who can stand up to you and is righteous and good.  And you liked Daniel's black hair, Geoffrey's
green eyes, and Marcus' glasses."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco thought that over.  "Yes, that's about right."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Draco," Lucius snapped.  "Doesn't that description <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>remind</i> you of anyone?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco thought for a moment,
then shook his head.  "Not really,
no."  He grabbed another pastry.  "Did I tell you that Potter was on the cover
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>four </i>magazines this week?  <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Four</i>!  <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quidditch
Enthusiasts</i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Witch Weekly,</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Warlock Wonders</i> and -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"ENOUGH!" Lucius roared,
standing up.  "You," he said sternly, pointing
a finger at his only child, "are obsessed with Harry Potter."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco rolled his eyes.  "No I'm not."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Yes</i>, you are," Lucius said firmly. 
"Draco, you have a problem, and your mother and I want you to get help."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco blinked.  "What?" he asked dumbly. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Help," Lucius repeated.  "Professional help.  You are going to see a doctor and you are
going to get over this obsession."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"But…but I don't…" Draco
stammered.  He turned to his mother.  "Mum! 
You're not going to let Dad make me go are you?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Narcissa smiled at him
sadly.  "Sorry sweetie," she said,
patting his hand.  "But you do seem to harbor
an unhealthy fascination with Harry Potter. 
It's for the best."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"But -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No more arguments, son.  You will see a doctor and that's final."
Lucius stared his son down.  "Unless, of
course, you'd like to stop living off your inheritance and get a job."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>And that explained why Draco
was now standing in front of the door to one Dr. Wu's office, about to have his
first appointment.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>'''''</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Go right on in, Mr. Malfoy.  Dr. Wu is expecting you."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco walked into a large
corner office that was comfortably furnished with a large maple wood desk, a
few comfortable looking chairs and a black leather chaise lounge.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mr. Malfoy." A pretty woman
with long black hair and glasses was standing behind a desk.  "A pleasure to see you."  She seemed to be hurriedly stuffing something
into the bottom drawer of her desk.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco ignored this.  "The feeling is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not </i>mutual<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>,</i>" he
sneered.  "I assure you if it weren't for
my parents I wouldn't even be here."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Your parents are most
concerned about you.  But perhaps we can
talk about it."  She gestured to the
chaise lounge.  "Please lay down."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco rolled his eyes and
sprawled out on his back on the chaise lounge. 
Dr. Wu took a seat in a chair next to him, just out of Draco's line of
vision.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So your mother tells me you
spend a lot of time talking about Harry Potter," she said simply, and Draco
exploded. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I am not obsessed with Harry
Potter!  I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>hate </i>the git.  He's so annoying
yet hot."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. Wu looked up from her
notes.  "Sorry?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>said</i> he's so annoying and what not. 
Are you deaf?" Draco sneered.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>The doctor chose to ignore her
patient's rudeness.  "So what happened to
make you hate him so much?"  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"He wouldn't be my friend!  Said I was the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>wrong sort</i>.  He decided to be
friends with that ginger tosser Ron Weasley instead!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"And you were angry…"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Damn straight I was angry.  I thought he was the prettiest boy I'd ever
seen!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>The doctor looked up from her
notes again.  "What was that?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought that was the
pettiest reason to make a scene.  You
really don't listen very well, do you?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>The doctor made a small
'hmmm' and went back to her notes.  "Did
you act out in anger towards Mr. Potter?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco smiled evilly.  "Did I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ever</i>."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"What did you do to him?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, our very first week I
stole his friend's Remembrall, and taunted him with my superior flying skills."  Draco made a face.  "Of course, that just landed him on the
Quidditch team as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>youngest seeker in
a century</i>," he finished mockingly.  "So
what if he flies amazingly?  He didn't
deserve to be seeker.  But it was no
matter, because next I challenged him to a midnight duel only to report him to the caretaker so he'd get detention.  Course he somehow wormed his way out of
trouble for that.  He's so good at
bending the rules, the stupid prat.  But
that was alright too, I had more ideas. 
So next I -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Actually, I think that will
be sufficient," Dr. Wu cut in quickly. 
"Just one last question.  What are
your feelings towards Mr. Potter himself?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"My feelings towards Potter?"
Draco repeated mockingly.  "I think he's
completely fit."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. Wu paused in her writing
for a moment.  "I'm sorry, I must have
heard wrong.  You think he's - what?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"A complete git," Draco supplied.  He paused for a moment.  "With ridiculous eyes," he added for good
measure. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I see." Dr. Wu scribbled
several things on a piece of paper.  "Thank
you, Mr. Malfoy.  This has been most
informative."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco scowled and slouched
sulkily on the chaise lounge.  He checked
his watch.  The WWN was running a special
retelling of Potter's amazing defeat of the Dark Lord in thirty minutes.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Not that he cared or
anything.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mr. Malfoy, are you familiar
with the term <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Freudian slip</i>?"  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Yes</i>," Draco snapped.  "But I
fail to see how it has any relevance to my situation."  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. Wu regarded him
thoughtfully for a moment.  "Alright
then.  We'll leave that for a later
session.  In the meantime, I have an
assignment for you.  Before our next
meeting, I would like you to send an owl to Harry Potter."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>That got Draco's
attention.  "What?" Draco gasped, bolting
upright in the chaise lounge.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You are old acquaintances.  Just send a simple letter saying hi.  That is all." 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"But -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"This is the first step to
recovery, Mr. Malfoy.  Re-establishing
contact."  Dr. Wu picked up a date book
and flipped through it.  "So, I shall be
seeing you at the same time next week. 
Good luck with your letter."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>'''''</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry Potter was his London flat that he shared with Ron Weasley and Hermione
Granger, staring into the fridge hoping that something tasty to eat would
somehow magically appear.  The fridge
wasn't listening to him.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Literally. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"How many times do I have to
tell you that I will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> make you
food, you lazy sod," the fridge snapped. 
"Make your own damn food.  You
should be happy I'm even willing to keep things cold for you.  Ungrateful tosser."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry rolled his eyes.  It would be just his luck that when he
enchanted his muggle appliances so they would work in his magical apartment, he
somehow managed to screw things up and animate them as well.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>He stood in front of the open
fridge a moment longer, idly scratching the thin strip of stomach visible
between his t-shirt and pajama bottoms, when Hermione came into the room.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Morning, Harry," she said,
hopping into one of the stools at their breakfast bar.  "How's the fridge today?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Being a wanker like usual,"
Harry said, shutting the door and reaching for a loaf of bread.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ooooh, an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>insult</i>!" the fridge mocked.  "The Great Harry Potter has insulted me!  Oh woe and suffering!  How will I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ever </i>survive?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal> Harry's fingers itched for his wand, but he
resisted.  The problem with magical
things with personalities is that it felt wrong to terminate them somehow.  Not that he wasn't often <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>sorely</i> tempted.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Toast?" he asked Hermione,
who had opened the copy of the Daily Prophet and was reading the
headlines.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes please," she said,
flipping the paper over to work on the crossroad puzzle.  Harry pulled out two slices of bread and walked
over to the toaster.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now Toaster," he said, his
voice soothing.  "I have two slices of
bread here.  Would you mind terribly -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh the HUMANITY!" the
toaster cried out.  "WHY?  Why are you so CRUEL?  Why do you ask me to TORMENT the innocent
BREAD?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"But the bread isn't <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>alive</i>! 
It won't feel a thing!  Can't you
just -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So CALLOUS you are.  So CRUEL. 
Can't you be satisfied with EATING it? 
Ripping it into shreds with your TEETH? 
Why must you TORTURE it first?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry massaged his temples at
his impending headache.  "Really, it's
just -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh it's just NOTHING to YOU.
You don't FEEL the PAIN!  But <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i> do! 
I feel the bread's pain like my own, and - "</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry promptly jammed the two
slices of bread into the toaster and pressed the lever down.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"NOOOOOOO!" the toaster
sobbed.  "WHY GOD?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"There is entirely too much
drama involved in making breakfast in this house," Harry commented, as he
watched the slices toast.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mmm-hmm," Hermione agreed,
tapping her quill against her mouth.  "Do
you know a six-letter word for light blonde hair?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Flaxen," Harry replied
promptly.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione raised an eyebrow,
but began writing.  "Thanks Harry," was
all she said.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron chose that moment to stroll
into the room.  "Morning," he said.  Like Harry, he was still in his pajamas.  He walked over to the fridge.  "How's the fridge today?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't bloody talk about me
like I'm not here," the fridge snarled. 
"Stupid ginger oaf."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"In top form, he is," Ron
muttered, opening the fridge.  After
making a face at its empty contents, he shut the door and looked longingly at
the toasting bread.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No way," Harry said quickly.  "You want toast you make your own.  I'm not fighting with the toaster again."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron sighed and reached into
the cupboard, pulling out a box of cereal which he began to eat straight from
the box.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So where's Meredith?" he
asked Harry pointedly.  "You had a date
with her last night.  I thought she would
have stayed over."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shrugged.  "I broke things off with her, actually.  She just wasn't right for me."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I could have told you that,"
Hermione muttered.  "Why'd you date her
in the first place?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"She had beautiful grey
eyes," Harry admitted.  "But she was
just…I dunno, too much of a good girl, I think."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"A good girl?" Ron
asked.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, too sweet and innocent."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"What's wrong with sweet and
innocent?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nothing, I just find it
boring," Harry admitted.  "I like my dates
a little bit wicked."  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You would," Ron said, making
a face.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So why'd you break up with Takami
then?  She was as bad as they come," Hermione
asked.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh yeah, she was.  It was hot. 
But she wasn't witty at all, never said anything funny."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron cocked his head to the
side.  "What about Marco?  Marco was witty."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Marco was impressed with my
fame and shit.  I don't want to date a
fan."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oliver?" Hermione pressed.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shook his head.  "I like my partners to like Quidditch, but
it's still my <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>job</i>, you know?  I don't want to talk about playing Quidditch
every minute of the day, and Oliver was obsessed with it.  He couldn't get it up unless we were
listening to a Quidditch game on the WWN."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron and Hermione both snorted
in amusement.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Gwyneth?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Most beautiful hair ever,"
Harry said with a sigh.  "That pretty
white-blonde color and so soft. But she was too polite.  I like partners who are feisty and maybe even
a little mouthy."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Philippe was mouthy.  He was a complete prat."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry scrunched up his
nose.  "But he had no <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>class</i>. 
I'm a slob who wears jeans everyday; I'm not looking for the same.  I like my guys to dress nice. I don't even mind
a little snottiness now and then.  It's
kind of cute."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron looked thoughtful.  "So your ideal partner would be a bit wicked
and witty, but not impressed by your fame. 
They'd like Quidditch but not obsess over it, dress nice, and be mouthy
and maybe even a little snotty.  You have
the weirdest taste <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ever</i>."  He snorted. 
"Oh, and it'd be great if they had white-blonde hair and grey eyes
because you think both of those are hot."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked thoughtful.  "Yeah, that sounds perfect," he said.  "Find me that person and I'll live happily
ever after."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron just shook his head.  Hermione looked at him in disbelief.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Um, Harry?" she ventured.  "Doesn't that description remind you of
someone we knew at school?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No.  Who?" Harry asked eagerly.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, who?" Ron echoed.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Um…" Hermione hesitated,
then smiled weakly. "No one.  Absolutely
no one.  Never mind."  She turned back to her paper.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry would have pressed it,
but at that moment there was a knock on the window.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh look, an owl," Harry
said, going to open the window.  The
elegant eagle owl flew in and dropped a letter on the counter before flying off
again.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron leaned over to look.  "It's for you Harry," he said, popping
another handful of cereal in his mouth. 
"Probably more fan mail."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry curiously picked up the
envelope.  It was deep green with silver
writing.  The front merely said "Potter"
with his address, and it was sealed with a big "M."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Slytherin colors," he
commented, sliding open the envelope.  He
unfolded the letter and read:</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Potter:</i></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hi.  </i></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Malfoy</i></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>Harry blinked.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"What's it say?" Hermione
asked.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Potter: Hi.  Malfoy," Harry read.  He paused. 
"That's an odd letter."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"What?  Let me see that," Ron said, grabbing the
letter out of Harry's hands.  He looked
at it closely.  "That <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> odd. 
Do you reckon it's from the ferret?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let me see," Hermione said,
standing up.  She took the letter.  "Hmmm." She looked at it more closely and
shrugged.  "Looks like Malfoy wants to
say hi."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"But…but why?" Harry said,
puzzled.  "I mean, I haven't spoken to
him since we left Hogwarts two years ago. 
I went on the play for the Canons, and last I heard he was just mooching
off his parents and doing a whole lot of nothing.  Why would that fine piece of work write to
me?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron and Hermione both snapped
their heads up to look at him. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"What did you say?" Ron asked
incredulously.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I said, why would that whiny
little berk write to me?" Harry repeated, slightly impatiently.  Ron looked relieved while Hermione raised an
eyebrow.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sure I don't know," she
said, handing back the letter.  "But you
should write him back."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Write him back?" Ron said,
scandalized.  "Don't do it, Harry.  It's Malfoy. 
He's an evil ferret."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ron, we haven't seen him in
two years.  Surely we can all put our
school rivalries behind us," Hermione said with a long-suffering sigh.  "Write him back Harry."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>So Harry did.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>'''''''</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco was about to leave for
his second session with Dr. Wu when a rapping noise sounded at his bedroom
window.  He walked over to it and slid it
open, and a gorgeous snowy owl flew into his room.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco peered closely.  "Hedwig?" he asked, stunned.  He'd recognize Potter's beautiful owl
anywhere.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Hedwig gave an important sort
of hoot and held out her leg.  Feeling
sort of surreal, he reached down and unfastened the letter.  He gave Hedwig an owl treat and absently
stroked her feathers for a moment.  She
hooted again and flew off, leaving Draco with a burgundy envelope addressed in
gold ink.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Draco Malfoy</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Malfoy Manor</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The envelope was
unsealed.  Draco carefully opened it and
read the contents:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hello.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"He wrote me back," Draco
informed Dr. Wu later that afternoon, waving the letter around.  "He's not an obsession, he's an
acquaintance.  Can I go now?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. Wu sighed.  "Mr. Malfoy, we have only just begun your
treatment.  But I am pleased you made
contact.  We can now move on to the next
step."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Which is…?" Draco asked. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"The Chudley Canons will be
playing the Montrose Magpies on Saturday. 
I would like you to attend that game and watch Mr. Potter play."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"What?" Draco gasped,
outraged.  "I will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i>.  I will not go to a game
and watch that sexy hunk play Quidditch."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I won't go to a game and
watch that cocky punk play Quidditch," Draco snapped. "Last thing he needs is
another fan at the game."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You will not be going as a
fan, Mr. Malfoy.  You will be going as a
patient.  I'm afraid I must insist upon
it.  You are of course, free to decline,
but your father would be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>most</i> upset
to hear that you have chosen not to go through with your therapy."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh bugger all," said Draco,
resigning himself to a Saturday from hell. 
</p>

it….he's going after it folks…he has GOT IT! 
Harry Potter has caught the snitch! 
The Canons win again, 230-80!"</b></p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Bloody brilliant," Draco
muttered under his breath, sinking down in his chair in the private viewing
booth he had paid for.  He wasn't going
to show his face to anyone; he didn't want a soul to know he was at a Canons
game and had just watched Harry fucking Potter play Quidditch.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>And he most certainly didn't
want a soul to know he turned on he was as a result.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>He'd forgotten how much he
loved watching Potter play.  The boy was
a natural on a broom.  His hair looked
good windswept, his cheeks turned pink in the wind, and he rode the broom with a
grace and control that did funny things to Draco's stomach.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Quickly pushing those
unwanted thoughts from his brain, he leaned down and reached into the bag he'd
brought with him.  The second part of
this exercise was to write Potter another letter after the game - an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>honest </i>letter about Potter's Quidditch
skills.  With a sigh he began.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Potter:</i></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Was at your match today.  You were pretty good.  Nice Wronski Feint in the middle there.  But don't let it go to your head.</i></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Malfoy</i></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>There, that should do.  He folded the letter and stuck it in an

He'd send it as soon as he got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This gets more and more
bizarre," Harry said, putting the letter on the counter for Ron and Hermione to
read.  "What's he trying to pull?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione regarded the letter
thoughtfully.  "Sounds like he's
complimenting you on your Quidditch skills."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know that's what it <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sounds</i> like," Harry said, sounding
peeved.  "But this is a letter from
Malfoy.  There's no way he's actually
complimenting me.  What is he trying to
do?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"It sounds like <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>twu wuv </i>to me," the stove chirped.  "He's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wooing</i>
you Harry; wooing you with compliments and lusty words.  Roses will be next, mark my words!" The stove
gave a happy sigh.  "What does Ronald
think about all this?" it cooed.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry started massaging his
temples again.  The stove was an
incurable romantic with absolutely no concept of how love really worked and a
crush on Ron.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Er, I'm with Harry.  Something fishy is going on here," Ron said,
a little uncomfortably.  "I mean, this <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is </i>Malfoy.  Who knows what sinister plans are lurking in
his evil, ferrety mind?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, just write him back
again Harry," Hermione said impatiently, shoving the letter back at Harry.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"But…but what if he -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Am I ever wrong?" Hermione
asked, and shooting her a dirty look Harry went to write a reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"YES, damn it, I would,"
Draco seethed.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. Wu nodded.  "Wonderful.

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione rolled her
eyes.  "NO, Harry.  He wouldn't try in such a public place.  Wait for the invitation to the dark alleyway
behind the old abandoned warehouse down by the docks before you suspect him of
murder."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't like this," Ron said
suspiciously.  "It sounds like he's
asking you on a date.  Why would he do

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh for the love of God, just

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco sat nervously in his
booth at the back of the Leaky Cauldron, sipping on his juice.  He had taken the liberty of ordering pumpkin
juice and a basket of chips to start with. 
He checked his watch:  11:58am.  He fidgeted
slightly.  Merlin, why was he so nervous?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
At 12:01, just when Draco was contemplating bolting because
Harry was late, the door to the pub swung open and in walked a vision in baggy
jeans and a well-fitting bright orange t-shirt.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco swallowed hard. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>The shirt was hideous; no one
could argue that.  A bright orange
Chudley Canons shirt would look good on absolutely nobody…</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>…except Potter.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Somehow the hideous orange
only set off his jet-black hair and his bright green eyes, and it clung perfectly
to Harry's flat abs and toned biceps. 
Draco could suddenly appreciate that it had been two years since they'd
left Hogwarts.  Two years since he'd seen
Potter up close, and the past two years of playing professional Quidditch had
been very, very good for Potter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Potter scanned the
restaurant, and Draco gave a small, tentative wave.  Harry's gaze rested on him, and Draco was
pleased to note the surprised widening of his eyes as he took in Draco's
appearance.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry wasn't the only one to
grow up over the last couple years.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal> Harry quickly shook off his surprised
expression and made his way towards Draco's booth in the back of the pub.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hi," he said uncertainly,
looking down at Draco.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hello," Draco said
back.  There was a moment's pause, then
Draco motioned to the seat.  "You can sit
down if you want."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry watched him warily as
he slid into the seat across from him.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>There was another
uncomfortable pause, then Draco lifted the basket of chips off the table.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Chips?" he said, holding it
out towards Harry.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry cautiously took a chip
out of the basket and, watching Draco the whole time, popped it in his
mouth.  He chewed for a moment then
swallowed, still watching Draco suspiciously. 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco couldn't help it.  He smirked maliciously.  "You've fallen into my trap, idiotic
Gryffindor," he said wickedly.  "The
chips were poisoned with a prick-shrinking potion, and soon your willy will be
the size of a twig."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry's eyes flew open in
horror and he looked like he might be sick. 
"Malfoy, you evil little shit! I'll fucking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>kill</i> you for this!"  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco burst out
laughing.  "I'm sorry Potter, I'm
sorry.  I couldn't resist.  You were watching me as if you suspected me
of some dastardly scheme, and I hated to let you down by offering you plain old
chips."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry stared at him.  "You were joking?" he asked, eyes narrowed
and body tense. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Absolutely.  Only thing dodgy on those chips is vinegar."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>At this, Harry's body relaxed
and he slumped in relief against the back of the booth.  "Thank God! 
Oh, you don't even want to know what I would have done to you if you'd
been serious."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco's prank had broken the
ice, however, and both boys were much more at ease now.  A waiter came by and took their order.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Did you really just order a
cosmopolitan at the Leaky Cauldron, Malfoy?" Harry asked when the waiter left,
shaking his head in amusement.  "Why
don't you spare yourself the trouble and just hang a big neon sign that reads <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nancy Boy </i>on your forehead?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco was surprised.  "You know I'm gay?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry lifted an eyebrow.  "Malfoy, I'm pretty sure <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Hedwig</i> knows you're gay."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ha ha, Potter," Draco said,
narrowing his eyes.  "At least I can pick
a gender. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Prophet's </i>had a field
day with your exploits.  Apparently
you'll sleep with anything in a skirt, pants, tie, Quidditch uniform or dress,
as long as it's got two legs."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not true," Harry
objected.  "I slept with a Centaur
once.  He had four legs."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco stared.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>This time it was Harry who
burst out laughing.  "I was joking, you
prat."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco cracked a smile.  "Wanker," he said, taking his glass from the
waiter as he arrived with their drinks.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Had to get you back for the
chips thing," Harry said, smiling.  "And
handsome as some centaurs may be, I'm not even sure I can fathom how one goes
about having sex with them."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not that complicated,
really," the waiter said, refilling Harry's glass of pumpkin juice.  "One just needs to be a little flexible.  It's well worth the effort, too.  Centaurs have quite amazing stamina."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and Draco gaped at him.
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Er…sorry.  Back to the kitchen I go," said the waiter
sheepishly, scurrying off. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco shook his head and took
a sip of his drink.  "Nice shirt Potter,"
he said sardonically.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked down at his neon
orange Chudley Canons shirt.  "What?" he
asked.  "I play for them now; I ought to
wear their clothes.  Plus it's soft."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco half amused by the soft
comment, and half annoyed with himself that Potter was wearing an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>orange </i>shirt and Draco still thought he
looked hot.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>He decided to stick with the
soft remark.  "So you like soft things,
do you?" he asked, and Harry shrugged.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Course I do," he said.  "I like how they feel against my skin."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco couldn't help but run a
hand through his hair at that.  He knew
he had exceptionally soft and silky hair, and over the past year he'd grown it
out and stopped gelling it back.  He
briefly wondered if Potter would like how his hair felt against his skin.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco looked up to find
Potter watching him raptly.  "What?" he
said defensively, and Harry had the grace to blush. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry," he said.  "I didn't mean to stare.  It's just…you look a little different than I
remember."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So do you," Draco
retorted.  "Did you grow half a foot or
what?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked amused.  "Well you look different too.  Not any taller, but you're not so scrawny
now."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Gee.  Thanks," Draco said sarcastically.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, I didn't mean -" Harry
reddened again.  "You look good, that's
all," he finally said, staring into his juice. 
"And I like your hair," he added, almost reluctantly.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco preened.  "Well, it is gorgeous hair.  And it's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very</i>
soft, you know." His eyes sparkled mischievously.  "Want to touch it?" he asked coyly, leaning
forward.  "You said you liked how soft
things feel against your skin."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was eagerly stretching
out a hand to touch Draco's hair.  Draco
closed his eyes in anticipation - he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>loved
</i>having his hair petted and played with - only to be rudely
interrupted.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Here's your fish and mushy
peas, boys, and another basket of chips," the waiter said cheerfully.  "Can I get you lads anything else?  Tea? 
Coffee?  Centaur porn?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"WHAT?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Cream horn.  I meant cream horn," the waiter said, and
took his leave.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Odd fellow, that one," Draco
commented, annoyed that he hadn't gotten his petting.  The food looked good though, and he and Harry
dug in.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>They ate in silence for a
while before Harry sprung the question.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So why'd you start writing
me out of the blue?" Harry asked, eating the last bites of his fried fish.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco's cheeks flushed ever
so slightly.  He'd been honestly enjoying
himself and had temporarily forgotten the point of this lunch.   "Oh, that. 
Well because…because…Imintherapy," he muttered to his mushy peas. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry, what?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco cleared his
throat.  "Therapy, Potter.  I'm in therapy, and my doctor made me write
to you."  There, it was out.  Draco's cheeks felt pink and hot, but he
bravely waited in anticipation of Harry's mocking laughter.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>To his great surprise, Harry
just shrugged.  "Alright then," he said
simply. He stared at Draco's half-eaten plate. "Say, are you going to eat your
other piece of fish?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco blinked in
surprise.  "You're not going to take the
piss out of me for seeing a shrink?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"God no," Harry said, looking
surprised that Draco would even suggest such a thing.  "I had to go through a year and a half of
therapy when the war was finally over. 
Having a Dark Lord trying to kill you since age eleven really screws
with your mind, let me tell you."  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>He paused.  "You didn't answer me about the fish," he
needled.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco pushed his plate across
the table, and Harry happily dug in.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hungry?" he asked, relieved
that Harry was unfazed by the therapy thing. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Starved," was Harry's reply,
as he continued to enjoy Draco's fish. 
"Been having a few problems in the kitchen lately."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh?  Like what? 
Spells gone wrong, that sort of thing?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Er…something like that,"
Harry said evasively.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco watched Harry eat for a
moment more before licking his lips nervously. 
There was another part to his therapy, and he wasn't looking forward to
it.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Potter?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah?" Harry said through a
mouthful of fish.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Um…so…right, so I'm in
therapy…you know this, I just told you…and…and well…my therapist wants me to
spend more time with you," he blurted out quickly.  "So could we maybe…you know…"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry raised an eyebrow.  "Hrph ra srecnd rate?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco furrowed his brow.  "What?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry swallowed.  "Have a second date?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>To his utmost horror, Draco
felt the tiniest tinge of pink heating up his cheeks.  "Well, I don't know if I'd call it a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>date </i>but…yeah…I guess…sort of…" he
trailed off, feeling his cheeks heat up even more at the thought that Harry
considered this lunch a "date."  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry took a long drink of
pumpkin juice before setting the glass down and looking at Draco appraisingly.  "Alright," he finally said.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Alright?" Draco repeated,
heart leaping.  "You'll do it?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shrugged.  "If it's part of your therapy, sure.  So, do you want to…I don't know…maybe come
over this weekend?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Come over?  Like, to your flat?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Um, yes.  That generally is where people are talking
about when they invite you over."  Harry
looked amused.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco was surprised.  He hadn't expected Potter to be so nice, or
so accommodating.  So the question was, did
he want to go over to Potter's place? 
Actually enter the abode of the Great Harry Potter?</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>He sort of did.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah sure," Draco replied,
smiling tentatively at Harry.  "What
time?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let's say seven on
Saturday.  And I may regret this, but how
about I make you dinner?  Or try to make
you dinner, at any rate."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Try to?  What, not much of a cook?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not that.  I'm actually quite a good cook.  Just come over this weekend and we'll see how
it goes."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>''''''</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, this is so <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>romantic</i>," the stove sighed, as Harry
frantically stirred the Alfredo sauce before it could burn.  "Shall I turn the burners up higher for you,
Harry love?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, thank you," Harry said
politely.  "They're quite high enough as
it is.  A little lower would be good,
actually."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"But the thought of you
making dinner for your little blonde cupcake makes me simmer," the stove cooed
dreamily.  "I just can't seem to turn
them down."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shook his head.  "Fine, just…try not to let it burn, alright?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>He leaned down to look at the
garlic bread in the oven, bracing himself when he opened the door.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"OH GOD!" it screamed.  "THEY'RE AFTER ME!  It's a CONSPIRACY, but I told them
NOTHING!  NOTHING, do you hear?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Shh, it's alright, nobody's
after you," Harry said soothingly.  He
was aware that he was trying to comfort his paranoid oven and probably sounded
ridiculous, but there it was.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Malfoy is coming to our
flat," Ron said, voice flat with dread. 
"Draco "The Ferret" Malfoy is coming to our flat because Harry <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>invited</i> him."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ron, really.  Malfoy is in therapy and Harry is helping
him.  We should be supportive," Hermione
chided, watching Harry pull a foil-wrapped loaf of bread from the sobbing oven.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, we should be offering to
put Harry <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>back</i> into therapy," Ron
said.  "Because he willingly invited
Malfoy into our flat and now he's making the ferret dinner."  He looked sulky.  "You never make me dinner."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry gave him a withering
look as he set the bread on the counter and charmed it to stay warm.  "You live here, prat.  I'm only willing to fight with the appliances
for guests."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I get no love," Ron said,
sighing loudly.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll take you out," Hermione
said placatingly.  "We can go to that
curry house you like."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No," Ron said sullenly.  "My best friend is making Fettuccini Alfredo
for my worst enemy.  I need comfort
food."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fine.  We'll visit your mother," Hermione said,
rolling her eyes at Harry behind Ron's back. 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron perked up.  "Alright," he said happily.  "Oooh, maybe the twins or Ginny will be there
and we can complain about what a git Malfoy is and how Harry's finally gone
round the twist for having him over."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sounds lovely," Hermione said,
winking at Harry.  She gave Ron a little
shove.  "Let's go.  Have a nice evening, Harry," she said, as she
and Ron left the kitchen.       </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry took a deep breath and
surveyed the dinner.  Everything looked
just about ready for a meal of homemade Fettuccini Alfredo, tossed salad and
garlic bread.  Nothing too fancy, but
hopefully Malfoy wouldn't laugh in his face either.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Not that he <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cared</i> if Malfoy laughed in his
face.  It wasn't like he was trying to…<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>impress</i> Malfoy or anything.  He only tried to impress the dates he wanted
to shag.  And he definitely didn't want
to shag Malfoy.  No way, no how.  No matter how good the ex-Slytherin had
looked in that tight grey jumper. Or the way his blonde hair fell so perfectly
around his face. Or the way his nose had kind of wrinkled in a cute way when he
laughed or the way he made those funny, snarky comments or - </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>A sneer interrupted Harry's
thoughts. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh isn't this <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>special</i>," the fridge said
scornfully.  "A lavish, homemade Italian
dinner. Having another floozy over to impress with tales of your heroics?  Or is it a well-dressed young man who will
simper over your Quidditch skills?  News
flash, Potter:  they only want you
because you're famous."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry closed his eyes and
began to rub his temples again.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>'''''''</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hi Malfoy, come on in,"
Harry said, in his best polite host voice, opening the door to let Draco
in.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks," Draco said, unable
to refrain from looking around curiously as he strode into Harry's flat.  It was nice. 
Not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Malfoy</i>-nice, but it was
clean and the furniture all matched and looked fairly new.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>He held out a bouquet of
flowers for Harry.  "These are for you."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked amused.  "You brought me <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>flowers</i>? That's so…masculine."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco gave him a haughty
look.  "It's impolite to go over to
someone's house without a present. 
Besides, you said you live with the Weasel and Granger.  Give them to her."   </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shrugged and took the
flowers.  "Alright.  Can I take your coat?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"That'd be lovely," Draco
said, still rather haughty.  He handed Harry
his black, full-length coat.  As Harry
turned to hang it in the coat closet, Draco took a minute to study his
appearance.  No Chudley Cannons shirt
this time.  Instead, Harry was wearing a
pair of khaki trousers and a white oxford shirt with a black sweater over
it.  The clothes fit Harry's toned body
perfectly, and Draco was impressed despite himself.    </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You know, seeing you in such
nice clothes makes me kind of horny," Draco said admiringly.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sorry?" Harry said,
spinning back around and looking surprised. 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco's eyes widened slightly
as he realized what he'd said.  "Um…I
said watch out for the roses. They're kind of thorny."  He punctuated this with a winning smile.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked at the
flowers.  "These are lilies."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco snapped his fingers.  "Right. 
So they are.  What's for dinner?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fettuccini Alfredo.  I hope that's alright."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sounds good.  Lead the way."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco followed Harry through
the sitting room into the kitchen.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"The food's all on the table
already," Harry explained.  "I'm just
grabbing drinks.  Pumpkin juice alright
with you?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Its fine," Draco said
distractedly, eyes darting all around the room. 
"Potter, is this a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>muggle </i>kitchen?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Half and half," Harry said
cagily.  He was reaching into a cabinet
and pulling down to glasses.  "Why don't
you go wait in the dining room?  I'll be
right in with the juice."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco wasn't listening.  His attention was completely absorbed by a
large, boxy-looking thing with handles against one wall.    </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"What on earth is this
thing?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry whirled around.  "Oy, Malfoy, you may not want to get too
close - "</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>The fridge stirred to life as
Draco investigated a magnet stuck to its outside. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh great," it sneered.  "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Another
</i>blonde.  Honestly Potter, why do you
do this to me?  I hate blondes; they're
dumb as dirt.  Besides, I think this one
is fake."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"WHAT?" Draco gasped,
outraged beyond belief.  "Who are you
calling a fake blonde, you loudmouthed piece of…well, whatever you are.  I am 100 percent natural, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>thank you very much</i>.  You're just jealous." </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh.  Right. 
I'm <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>jealous</i>," the fridge
scoffed.  "Wish my hair was blonde.  OH WAIT. 
I don't have hair.  Honestly."  The fridge made an irritated clucking
noise.  "Seriously Potter, get your whiny
bottle-blonde brat of a boyfriend out of here.  He's annoying."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked angry.  "Now you listen here, Fridge," he said in an
authoritative I'm-Harry-Fucking-Potter-So-Don't-Give-Me-Any-Shit voice that
sent shivers down Draco's spine.  "I
won't have you insulting my guests. 
Apologize to Malfoy."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you want an apology, or
do you want your eggs to stay fresh?" the fridge said haughtily.  "I can let the milk spoil too.  The choice is yours, Potter."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You leave them alone."  A stern but rather high-pitched and bubbly
voice piped up from the other side of the kitchen.  "Don't go bothering Harry when he's got a
date."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>The refrigerator gave a
long-suffering sigh.  "Oh, of course, the
sentimental stove wants in on the conversation. 
Getting your jollies off of Potter's latest conquest, are you?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't talk to the stove like
that!" the toaster snapped.  "I don't
want to see anyone SUFFER!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"SUFFER?  Oh God, is that a THREAT?!" the oven
screamed.  "They're coming for me, AREN'T
THEY?  NOOOOOO!!  I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE!!!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>The appliances all started to
talk or yell or sulk or snap at once. 
Draco began to slowly back up, eyes wide.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly, a strong hand was
gripping his wrist and a low voice was whispering in his ear.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dining room," Harry
hissed.  "Now.  Move quietly."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco nodded, and he and Harry
slowly tiptoed out of the kitchen.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>''''''</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as they were in the
dining hall, Harry shut the door.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Whew," he said, as the
noises from the kitchen were drowned out. 
"That was close."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Potter, what the hell is
wrong with everything in that room?" Draco demanded.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, I did say I'd been
having a few problems in the kitchen lately." 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought you meant you'd
blown up a casserole or something!  Not
that everything in your kitchen is completely barking mad!  You actually made <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>dinner </i>with those things?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry pointed to the spread
on the table.  "I did. And it turned out
fine.  Now can I dish you some pasta?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco paused in his rant and
glared at Harry.  Then he looked at the
food.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, alright," he agreed
grudgingly.  "It does look pretty good."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry dished up everything
and soon they were eating in a fairly amicable silence.  After a bit Draco remembered that he was
supposed to be talking with Harry as part of his therapy, so he cleared his
throat.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So…uh…how have you been doing
anyway, Potter?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry swallowed his mouthful
of salad.  "Well, now that you're here
I'm awfully randy."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>WHAT</i>?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Um…I mean…I'm doing just fine
and dandy," Harry said, not meeting Draco's eyes.  He quickly reached for the pasta.    </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco furrowed his brow.  Had Harry just said…?</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>He shook his head to clear it
of that silly thought.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"How about yourself?  How are you doing?" Harry asked
politely.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Great, although I'd love to
kiss you," Draco said, and then bit his lip.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry jerked his head up from
where he was dishing more pasta. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry - what?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Great, although I've missed
you," Draco quickly blurted.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh."  Harry was looking at him suspiciously.  "Well, um…I guess I've missed you too."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco smiled weakly.  "Can I have more pasta?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry nodded and began
dishing more Fettuccini Alfredo onto Draco's plate.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So…who's the lucky lad or
lady this week in the Great Harry Potter's love life?" Draco said, taking his
plate back and trying to change the subject. 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry took a thoughtful bite.  "No one right now.  But if I had my way, you're the one I'd like
to snog."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco nearly choked.  "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>WHAT</i>?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked panicked.  "I mean - you're a hog.  Um…ing. 
Hogging.  Um…the pasta.  Right! 
You're hogging the pasta. Yes." 
Harry quickly averted his eyes and picked up his pumpkin juice again.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco narrowed his eyes.  "You just dished out my pasta for me."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So I did."  Harry still wasn't looking at him.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco began to eat again,
very slowly.  The silence between them
was now a bit tense.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry cleared his
throat.  "Can I get you anything else?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco licked his lips.  "How about a one-way ticket to your bed?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>This time Harry almost
choked.  "I'm sorry - <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>what</i>?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Shit, I didn't mean to say that</i>, Draco thought, panicked.  "Uh…could you pass me some garlic bread?" he
said, a little too sweetly, pointing at the buttery, steaming hot bread.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh.  Right. 
Right.  Sure."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry quickly passed the loaf
towards Draco, and then jumped to his feet. 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ready for dessert?" he said
in a would-be casual voice.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco nodded, and then
watched as Harry rummaged around in a bag on the floor and pulled out two bars
of Honeyduke's best chocolate.  He tossed
one to Draco.  "Here you are."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco caught the bar and
looked at it with a raised eyebrow.  "Homemade
Fettuccini Alfredo for dinner and your grand finale is a bar of chocolate?" </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked a little embarrassed.  "Well, I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>was</i>
going to make a chocolate torte for dessert, but …you see, our mixer and our
blender have been together for three weeks, and the blender was just discovered
having a torrid affair with the microwave. 
The mixer is devastated and inconsolable, so now we just sort of avoid
doing any mixing."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're mad, Potter," Draco
said, a sort of awe in his voice. 
"Absolutely mad."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shrugged.  "I must be. 
I had you over, didn't I? Of course, you are rather stunning."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco froze, chocolate
half-way to his mouth.  "You just said
I'm stunning," he said, shocked.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry's widened, but he
immediately shook his head.  "I didn't,"
he denied.  "I said <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>cunning</i>."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, you said stunning.  You think I'm stunning."  Draco smirked triumphantly.  "Well, well, well," he said mockingly, to
Harry's horrified face.  "The Famous
Harry Potter thinks Draco Malfoy is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stunning</i>.  That's something for the papers.  But you can just keep dreaming, Potter.  You don't get a piece of this bad boy just
because you'd be a great shag."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as he said the words,
Draco clapped a hand over his mouth in horror. 
Harry stared incredulously at him. 
</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Did you just say I'd be a
great shag?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"What?  No, of course not.  Don't be silly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think you did.  I think you said I'd be a great shag."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>didn't</i>.  I said you're a
total hag."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry raised a skeptical
eyebrow.  "Are you sure?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Positive."  Draco made a scoffing noise. "Like I think
you'd be a great shag.  Please.  I mean, I do think you're hot - damn it, I
mean a sot, a stupid sot!."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"HA!" Harry pointed at
him.  "I told you!  You think I'm hot! You want to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shag</i> me!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't!" Draco said,
panicked.  How did Harry suddenly switch
things around on him?  "You're the one
who thinks I'm stunning!"  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"So?  You think I'm hot and you want to shag me!"
Harry said triumphantly.  "Well too bad
for you, because it's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never </i>going to
happen.  Just because I'd love to hear
you call me Daddy - wait <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no</i>, I meant I
need to get your…um…addy, you know, your address -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"A HA!" Draco said, jumping
to his feet.  "You've already sent me Owl
Post! You already know my address!  You
want to hear me call you Daddy because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you're</i>
the one who wants to shag <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me</i>!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>don't</i>!" Harry said wildly, jumping to his feet as well. "Look, all I
said was that I wanted to score…no wait, I meant I'd love to give you a right
good what-for…oh <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bollocks</i>, that is
definitely <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> what I meant either -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now who wants to shag who,
eh Potter?" Draco said victoriously, putting his hands on the table and leaning
forward aggressively.  "And you're a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pervert</i> about it too.  At least I just want to shag you while you're
tied up tight - shit, I mean I want to ride you all night - wait no, not that
either -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Pot calling the kettle black
much?" Harry spat back, mirroring Draco's position.  "Who's the pervert now?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and Draco were both
leaning forward over the small table; their faces inches apart as they shouted
at each other and their slips became more and more ridiculous.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're the pervert!" Draco
said forcefully.  "Just because I think
you'd be a great top - oh fuck no, I meant a total <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>flop</i> -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Think I'd make a great top,
do you?" Harry said with relish.  "Well I
think you've got a hot arse - wait no, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no</i>!
I meant…um…larce!  Yes, larce!  Like…<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>larceny</i>!  You know, larceny, like does your daddy know
he raised a thief because baby you've just stolen my breath away - oh <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shit</i>, I did <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not </i>just <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>say</i> that -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just admit you want me,
Potter," Draco sneered, hands on the table for balance and leaning in even
closer.  "Admit you want me and I'll
admit you have a really hot body - wait, I mean that you're just really <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shoddy</i> -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"That doesn't make any sense,
you fuckwit! You think you can say whatever you want just because you've got that
gorgeous hair - no wait, because you've got an evil <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>stare</i> -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"An evil stare?" Draco
repeated scornfully.  "That's the best
you can do? Just admit it.  You want to
shag me.  You're gagging for it.  You WANT me."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"No!" Harry said
desperately.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"YES!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"NO!!!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"YES!!! ADMIT IT POTTER!  YOU WANT ME! 
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>YOU</i>. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>WANT</i>. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ME</i>.  HARRY POTTER WANTS TO SHAG DRACO MALFOY!  YOU WANT TO SHAG ME AND YOU SHOULD JUST ADMIT
IT!!!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"FINE!" Harry bellowed.  "I ADMIT IT! YOU'RE HOT AND I WANT YOU AND
I'M GOING TO SHAG YOU RIGHT HERE ON THIS TABLE!"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ha HA!" Draco crowed
triumphantly.  "I told you you want me!  You just admitted that you want me and - wait,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>what did you just say</i>?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>It was too late.  Harry had reached out and grabbed the back of
Draco's head with one hand and leaned forward to plant a hard, wet kiss right
on Draco's lips.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mmrph!" Draco gasped,
unwittingly opening his mouth.  And then
Harry's tongue was in his mouth, battling with his own tongue, and Harry Potter
was kissing Draco Malfoy so hard it was taking Draco's breath away.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>And suddenly it didn't matter
who wanted who or who had made what ridiculous Freudian slip because Draco
wanted Harry, and he wanted to shag Harry, and at that moment he would have
admitted it to anyone straight up that what he wanted was Potter on a silver
platter, or naked and tied to the bedpost, whichever was faster.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>In an instant he had reached
out and sunk both his hands into Harry's thick, messy locks.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You want me so bad," he
moaned against Harry's mouth, tugging hard on Harry's hair.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Too fucking right I do,"
Harry growled.  With his free hand he
reached down and swiped, sending all the dishes flying off the table with a
loud crash.  Draco immediately put his
knee onto the table and climbed on.    </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry wasted no time climbing
on the table as well, and the boys kissed each other fiercely as they began
trying to wrestle each other down to the surface of the table.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry, being slightly bigger
and in better shape from Quidditch, quickly won the wrestling match and had
Draco pinned on his back in under a minute.</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Gotcha!" he said
triumphantly, as Draco squirmed on the table beneath him.  "Now what should I do with you?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco reached up and grabbed the
front of Harry's shirt.  With a hard tug,
he yanked Harry's face down to his own.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"You should kiss me," he said
breathlessly, lips only inches from Harry's. 
"You should kiss me and then you should touch me and then you should
shag me until I can't see straight and the table collapses under us and then we
should move to your bed so you can do it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>again</i>."</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shuddered above
him.  "You are so unbelievably hot,
Draco."  Then his eyes went wide.  "Wait, I didn't mean to say Draco, I meant to
say -"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes you did, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Harry</i>," Draco said, eyes glinting
mischievously.  "From now on, what do you
say we both say what we mean and leave the Freudian slips to the doctors?"</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Brilliant," Harry said with
a smile, and they began to kiss again. </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>'''''''''</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dear Dr. Wu,</i></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I just thought you might like to know that your
therapy was a great success.  Harry
Potter and I are now an item.  Thanks for
your help.  Send the bill to my dad.</i></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Draco Malfoy</i></p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. Wu smiled as she read the
letter in her hand.  She set it on the
surface of the desk, and then leaned down in her chair.  She opened the bottom drawer of the desk and
pulled out a large, framed picture of Harry Potter, resplendent in his Chudley
Cannons Seeker uniform.  </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>To Dr. Wu, the World's Best Therapist</i>, the autograph in the corner of the photo read.  <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thanks
for all the help.  Sincerely, Harry
Potter.</i></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. Wu fondly remembered the
days of having Harry Potter in her office:</p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"I appreciate all the help
with this Voldemort stuff, but I don't think I know what you mean when you say
'Freudian Slip,'" Harry had said thoughtfully. "I really don't think I'm
harboring any subconscious desire for a former childhood rival." </p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>"Of course not, Mr. Potter,"
Dr. Wu had said patiently.  "Harry Potter
and his former rival Draco Malfoy want to shag each other senseless? Surely
not!  What utter rot!  Perish the thought!"     <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal>And of course, what she really
meant was: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Damn, that'd be hot!</i></p>

 

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>
